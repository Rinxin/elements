# Aurora Builder (Mraz Homebrew)
This is my adjusted library for Aurora Builder. I have included all the content I own and allow my players to use, and the homebrew ideas either I have made or have found on the various websites or creators on the web. Where I can verify the creator I will make a source id for them, otherwise I will list them under Unknown Creator source.


Visit the [website](http://www.aurorabuilder.com "Aurora Website") for more information about the Aurora character builder and check out the [support page](http://www.aurorabuilder.com/support "Aurora Support Page") if you have any questions.<br>



### Extending Content
I have condensed content into a file per source. An example would be a file for all of the Wizards of the Coast Materials. I did this to prevent copies cluttering the tool for my players.  

### Things that would be nice to add
- the ability to generate arrays or lists of items to have stores.
- 
Go to the _Additional Content_ tab in Aurora, enter the URL of the index file, and have Aurora download the content to the custom folder for you. When these files get updated, Aurora will be able to keep content files up to date automatically.
