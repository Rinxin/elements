			<p><strong><em>Unleash the horrors of Ravenloft in this campaign sourcebook for the world’s greatest roleplaying game.</em></strong></p>
			<p>Terror stalks the nightmare realms of Ravenloft. No one knows this better than monster scholar Rudolph Van Richten. To arm a new generation against the creatures of the night, Van Richten has compiled his correspondence and case files into this tome of eerie tales and chilling truths.</p>
			<p>Discover the mysteries of Ravenloft, mist-shrouded lands where infamous Darklords lurk among ageless vampires, zombie hordes, cosmic terrors, and worse. Then make your choice. Will you create your own Domains of Dread, settings to host endless terrifying adventures? Or will you join the ranks of haunted heroes who embrace macabre lineages, dual-edged Dark Gifts, haunted subclasses, and other forbidden powers?</p>
			<p>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft contains everything you need to craft a horror-themed campaign for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Unleash a treasure trove of new story hooks, character options, and campaign customization to bring one of the most exciting Dungeons &amp; Dragons settings to life!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Travel (perhaps even by choice) to familiar domains and discover new ones—as Ravenloft’s expanded Domains of Dread return for the first time in fifth edition! Includes rules and advice for building custom domains and Darklords using established horror tropes or your own special blend.</li>
				<li>Discover a host of new backgrounds and trinkets themed specifically for a horror setting, as well as new character lineages, including the dhampir, hexblood, and reborn.</li>
				<li>Find two new subclasses, the College of Spirits for bards and the Undead pact for warlocks.</li>
				<li>Explore Dark Gifts for characters that flesh out your place in the Domains of Dread.</li>
				<li>Encounter a horrific assortment of creatures from the monstrous bestiary.</li>
				<li>And includes a brand-new adventure!</li>

			<p>When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or 
			point buy.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
			<p class="indent">Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature of the Construct type.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Poised between the worlds of the living and the dead, dhampirs retain their grip on life yet are endlessly tested by vicious hungers. Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s deathless prowess in the form of a increased speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite.</p>
			<p class="indent">With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who’d tempt their hunger.</p>
			<h4>DHAMPIR HUNGERS</h4>
			<p>Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. Those who overindulge their risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress them through constant, molar-grinding restraint. In any case, temptation haunts dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give them endless reasons to indulge.</p>
			<p class="indent">While many dhampirs thirst for blood, your character might otherwise gain sustenance from the living. Roll on or choose an option from the Dhampir Hungers table to determine what tempts your character to feed.</p>

			<h4>DHAMPIR ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>Dhampirs often arise from encounters with vampires, but all manner of macabre bargains, necromantic influences, and encounters with mysterious immortals might have transformed your character. The Dhampir Origins table provides suggestions for how your character gained their lineage.</p>

			<h4>DHAMPIRS IN THE DOMAINS OF DREAD</h4>
			<p>When creating a dhampir, ask your DM if it makes sense for your character to have ties to one of the following Domains of Dread.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Barovia.</strong> In the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, tales flourish of those who love or descend from vampires. You might have such a connection, but dread what would happen if others in your insular community found out.</li>
				<li><strong>Darkon.</strong> The Kargat, this shattered domain’s secret police, supposedly know the secret of immortality. Perhaps you joined and advanced through their lesser ranks, known as a Kargatane, and were rewarded by being transformed into a dhampir.</li>
				<li><strong>I’Cath.</strong> At night, the starving city of I’Cath is overun by vampiric jiangshi. You were left with a cold hunger after an ancounter with one of these unquiet ancestors.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>DHAMPIR TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 35 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ancestral Legacy.</em></strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Deathless Nature.</em></strong> You don’t need to breathe.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vampiric Bite.</em></strong> Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you attack with this bite and hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:</p>
			<ul>

		<description>
			<p>Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag’s influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as darkvision and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.</p>
			<p class="indent">While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.</p>
			<h4>HEIR OF HAGS</h4>
			<p>One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called an eldercross or a witch’s turn. This living, garland-like part of a hexblood’s body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.</p>
			<h4>HEXBLOOD ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>A bargain with a hag or other eerie forces transformed your character into a magical being. Roll on or choose an option from the Hexblood Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">HEXBLOOD ORIGINS</h5>

				<tr><td>3</td><td>A coven of hags lost one of its members. You were created to replace the lost hag.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You were cursed as a child. A deal with the spirits of the forest transformed you into a hexblood, now free of the curse.</td></tr>

			<h4>HEXBLOODS IN THE DOMAINS OF DREAD</h4>
			<p>When creating a hexblood, consult with your DM to see if it’s appropriate to tie your origins to one of the following Domains of Dread.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Hazlan.</strong> The bizarre magic of this crumbling domain exposes the populace to supernatural forces, occasionally giving rise to hexbloods.</li>
				<li><strong>Kartakass.</strong> Whimsical witches make their homes in the forests of Kartakass. They eagerly grant the wishes of locals seeking grand fortunes for their children.</li>
				<li><strong>Tepest.</strong> Many of the children in the town of Viktal are hexbloods who exhibit their supernatural natures from a young age. Each youngster is considered a gift from the town’s patron deity, who is known as Mother.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>HEXBLOOD TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Fey.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Eerie Token.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of your hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can take these actions:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Telepathic Message.</em></strong> As an action, you can send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Remote Viewing.</em></strong> If you are within 10 miles of the token, you can enter a trance as an action. The trance lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or are incapacitated. During this trance, you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token’s location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. When the trance ends, the token is harmlessly destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you create a token using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hex Magic.</em></strong> You can cast the disguise self and hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.</p>

			<p>Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>
			<h4>FADED MEMORIES</h4>
			<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Memory</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>A memory brings tears to your eyes. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You recall enjoying something that you can’t stand doing now. What is it? Why don’t you like it now?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience?</td></tr>

			<h4>REBORN ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>Reborn might originate from circumstances similar to those of various undead or constructs. The Reborn Origins table provides suggestions for how your character became reborn.</p>

				<tr><td>1</td><td>You were magically resurrected, but something went wrong.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Stitches bind your body’s mismatched pieces, and your memories come from multiple different lives.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>After clawing free from your grave, you realized you have no memories except for a single name.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You were a necromancer’s undead servant for years. One day, your consciousness returned.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You awoke in an abandoned laboratory alongside complex designs for clockwork organs.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>You were released after being petrified for generations. Your memories have faded, though, and your body isn’t what it once was.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Your body hosts a possessing spirit that shares its memories and replaces your missing appendages with phantasmal limbs.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>In public, you pass as an unremarkable individual, but you can feel the itchy straw stuffing inside you.</td></tr>

			<h4>REBORN IN THE DOMAINS OF DREAD</h4>
			<p>When creating a reborn, consult with your DM to see if it’s appropriate to tie your origins to one of the following Domains of Dread.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Har’Akir.</strong> You died and endured the burial rites of this desert realm, yet somehow a soul—yours or another’s—has taken refuge in your perfectly preserved remains.</li>
				<li><strong>Lamordia.</strong> You awoke amid the bizarre experiments of an amoral scientist. They consider you their finest creation or have a task for you to fulfill.</li>
				<li><strong>Mordent.</strong> You emerged from the mysterious device known as the Apparatus, your body a lifeless shell and your past a mystery.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>REBORN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>You have the following racial traits.</p>			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ancestral Legacy.</em></strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Deathless Nature.</em></strong> You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Knowledge from a Past Life.</em></strong> You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>You relentlessly seek the truth. Perhaps you’re motivated by belief in the law and a sense of universal justice, or maybe that very law has failed you and you seek to make things right. You could have witnessed something remarkable or terrible, and now you must know more about this hidden truth. Or maybe you’re a detective for hire, uncovering secrets for well-paying clients. Whether the mysteries you’re embroiled in are local crimes or realm-spanning conspiracies, you’re driven by a personal need to hunt down even the most elusive clues and reveal what others would keep hidden in the shadows.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from among Insight, Investigation, or Perception</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Disguise kit, thieves’ tools</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A magnifying glass, evidence from a past case (choose one or roll for a trinket from the Horror Trinkets table later in this chapter), a set of common clothes, and 10 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>PATH TO MYSTERY</h4>
			<p>Your first case influenced the types of mysteries you’re interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose details from the First Case table to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">CASE</h5>
			<table>

					<tr><td>d8</td><td>Case</td></tr>

				<tr><td>1</td><td>A friend was wrongfully accused of murder. You tracked down the actual killer, proving your friend’s innocence and starting your career as a detective.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>You’re told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you’ve continued to uncover magical hoaxes.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You’re still trying to prove what you know is true.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can’t solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay.</td></tr>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shadow Strike.</em></strong> When you make a melee attack roll, you can increase your reach for that attack by 10 feet. Your shadow stretches and delivers the attack as if it were you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ominous Will.</em></strong> Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your shadow exerts a will of its own and might assist or hinder you or those around you. The next time you or a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, roll a d4. If the number is odd, reduce the total by the number rolled. If the number is even, increase the total by the number rolled. Once this effect occurs, it can’t happen again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>The Mists grip all who tread the Domains of Dread, but you know how to slip through their grasp. You can navigate the Mists successfully given enough time and a little luck, but this freedom comes with a price; if you remain in one area for too long, the Mists find you and drain your life force.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Misty Travels table to determine how you developed this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> You can cast the misty step spell, requiring no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mist Traveler.</em></strong> When you enter the Mists intent on reaching a specific domain, you are treated as if you possess a Mist talisman keyed to that domain. To use this trait, you must know the name of the domain you have chosen as your destination, but you don’t need to have previously visited that land. This trait doesn’t allow you to bypass domain borders closed by a Darklord’s will.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Poisoned Roots.</em></strong> When you finish a long rest, the world around you in a 10-mile radius becomes a siphon that will eventually leech away your vitality. You can remain in the area safely for a number of weeks equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 week). Thereafter, each time you finish a long rest in the area, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion that can’t be removed while you remain in the area.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance, either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote’s desires, it might strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll on or choose an option from the Symbiotic Nature table to determine what sort of symbiotic being shares your body. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SYMBIOTIC NATURE</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Symbiote</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Tiny humanoid facial features protruding from your torso, palm, or the back of your head</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>An alien appendage inside an unhealing wound</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>A burrowing, worm-like being</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>An intrusive thought that inhabits your mind</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>A living tattoo</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Crystal growths that replace a portion of your body</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Entwined Existence.</em></strong> Your symbiote is a separate entity with its own physical form bound to yours. It isn’t a separate creature and relies on you to survive. It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote’s abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.</p>
			<p class="indent">The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don’t already have it, representing the symbiote’s counsel and guidance.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you die, so does your symbiote. If you are subsequently returned to life, your symbiote revives as well.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sustained Symbiosis.</em></strong> Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbiotic Agenda.</em></strong> Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don’t act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote’s Charisma modifier) or be charmed by the symbiote for 1d12 hours. While charmed, you must try to follow the symbiote’s commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll or choose from the Symbiotic Agenda table to determine the symbiote’s goal, working with your DM to detail the specifics or create another agenda.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SYMBIOTIC AGENDA</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Agenda</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>The symbiote seeks to destroy a specific type of being, such as fiends, trolls, or paladins.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>The symbiote craves knowledge and is determined to solve a mystery or learn a secret.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>The symbiote wants to bring a prophecy to fruition or to thwart one.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>The symbiote seeks to defend the servants and interests of a powerful being or organization.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>The symbiote wants to keep you from harm at all costs and believes it knows what’s best for you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>The symbiote seeks to experience new sensations, the more bizarre the better.</td></tr>

On a hit, the target takes an additional 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Inescapable Death.</em></strong> When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal necrotic damage, you ignore the target’s resistance to that damage.</p>

These creatures act like normal examples of their kind, but their behavior suggests a hint of malice. No matter what precautions you take, you can’t permanently drive these spirits away.
