			<p><strong><em>A magical mixture of rules options for the world's greatest roleplaying game.</em></strong></p>
			<p>The wizard Tasha, whose great works include the spell Tasha’s hideous laughter, has gathered bits and bobs of precious lore during her illustrious career as an adventurer. Her enemies wouldn’t want these treasured secrets scattered across the multiverse, so in defiance, she has collected and codified these tidbits for the enrichment of all.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>EXPANDED SUBCLASSES. Try out subclass options for every Dungeons &amp; Dragons class, including the artificer, which appears in the book.</li>
				<li>MORE CHARACTER OPTIONS. Delve into a collection of new class features and new feats, and customize your character’s origin using straightforward rules for modifying a character’s racial traits.</li>
				<li>INTRODUCING GROUP PATRONS. Whether you're part of the same criminal syndicate or working for an ancient dragon, each group patron option comes with its own perks and types of assignments.</li>
				<li>SPELLS, ARTIFACTS &amp; MAGIC TATTOOS. Discover more spells, as well as magic tattoos, artifacts, and other magic items for your campaign.</li>
				<li>EXPANDED RULES OPTIONS. Try out rules for sidekicks, supernatural environments, natural hazards, and parleying with monsters, and gain guidance on running a session zero.</li>
				<li>A PLETHORA OF PUZZLES. Ready to be dropped into any D&amp;D adventure, puzzles of varied difficulty await your adventurers, complete with traps and guidance on using the puzzles in a campaign.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Full of expanded content for players and Dungeon Masters alike, this book is a great addition to the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Baked in you'll find more rule options for all the character classes in the Player's Handbook, including more subclass options. Thrown in for good measure is the artificer class, a master of magical invention. And this witch's brew wouldn't be complete without a dash of added artifacts, spellbook options, spells for both player characters and monsters, magical tattoos, group patrons, and other tasty goodies.</p>

If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.</p>

The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears.

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall unconscious for the spells’ duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world’s existence, even if you don’t know the world’s name. Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn’t transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all other creatures, with none of you being transported.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

When found, the book contains the following spells: enlarge/reduce, feather fall, flesh to stone, gaseous form, magic weapon, and polymorph. It functions as a spellbook for you.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.</li>
				<li>As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.</li>

	<element name="Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle" type="Magic Item" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_MAGIC_ITEM_BABA_YAGAS_MORTAR_AND_PESTLE">
		<description>
			<p>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Mortar.</em></strong> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there’s enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Pestle.</em></strong> The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Perfect Tools.</em></strong> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also use the artifact as alchemist’s supplies, brewer’s supplies, cook’s utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner’s kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Primal Parts.</em></strong> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that’s equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target’s hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Traverse the Night.</em></strong> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">You don’t need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon’s lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bones Know Their Home.</em></strong> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.</em></strong> The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.</p>

			<p>This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the scrying spell.

			<p class="indent">If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 7 days.</p>

The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.</p>

	<element name="Crook of Rao" type="Magic Item" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_MAGIC_ITEM_CROOK_OF_RAO">
		<description>
			<p>Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact’s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Absolute Banishment.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can’t return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Failing Matrix.</em></strong> Whenever the Crook of Rao ’s Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Iggwilv’s Curse.</em></strong> When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying or Repairing the Crook.</em></strong> The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.</p>

			<p>An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light. While you are touching the crystal, you can retrieve and store information and spells within the crystal at the same rate as reading and writing. When found, the crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress,* Rary’s telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha’s mind whip,* and Tenser’s floating disk (spells with an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing psychically encoded within it.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If you spend 1 minute studying the information within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book.</li>

	<element name="Demonomicon of Iggwilv" type="Magic Item" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_MAGIC_ITEM_DEMONOMICON_OF_IGGWILV">
		<description>
			<p>An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss’s infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha’s hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Abyssal Reference.</em></strong> You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>
			<p class="indent"></p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fiendish Scourging.</em></strong> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ensnarement.</em></strong> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Containment.</em></strong> The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon’s empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Demonomicon.</em></strong> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord FrazUrb’luu instantly knows.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features beautiful calligraphy, images of writing implements, and the like.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tattoo Attunement.</em></strong> To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magical Scribing.</em></strong> While this tattoo is on your skin, you can write with your fingertip as if it were an ink pen that never runs out of ink.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can touch a piece of writing up to one page in length and speak a creature’s name. The writing becomes invisible to everyone other than you and the named creature for the next 24 hours. Either of you can dismiss the invisibility by touching the script (no action required). Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

				<li>As an action, you can expend 1 charge to take on a semblance of undeath for 10 minutes. For the duration, you take on a deathly appearance, and undead creatures are indifferent to you, unless you have damaged them.

	<element name="Luba’s Tarokka of Souls" type="Magic Item" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_MAGIC_ITEM_LUBAS_TAROKKA_OF_SOULS">
		<description>
			<p>Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.</p>
			<p class="indent">Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba’s Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck’s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.</p>
			<p class="indent">Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Enduring Vision.</em></strong> While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Twist of Fate.</em></strong> As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Weal.</strong> The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Woe.</strong> The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p>
			<p class="indent">The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Prisoners of Fate.</em></strong> Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Souls of the Tarokka</h5>

			<p class="indent">The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck’s Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shuffling Fate.</em></strong> If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba’s Tarroka of Souls ends, and you can’t attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Deck.</em></strong> Luba’s Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM’s design</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>feature.</em></strong> Mother Luba and the Vistani. The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists</p>
			<p class="indent">A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."</p>
			<p class="indent">Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.</p>

	<element name="Mighty Servant of Leuk-o" type="Magic Item" source="Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything" id="ID_WOTC_TCOE_MAGIC_ITEM_MIGHTY_SERVANT_OF_LEUK_O">
		<description>
			<p>Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p>
			<p class="indent">Tales of the servant’s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device’s origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer’s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad’s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dangerous Attunement.</em></strong> Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.</p>
			<p class="indent">The servant’s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.</p>
			<p class="indent">Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Controlling the Servant.</em></strong> While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster’s next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li>
				<li>Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li>
				<li>As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li>
				<li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ghost in the Machine.</em></strong> Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM’s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Self-Destruct.</em></strong> By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant’s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p>
			<p class="indent">This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p>
			<p class="indent"></p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Servant.</em></strong> The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant’s self-destruct property.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using the Teeth.</em></strong> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).</p>
			<p class="indent">If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).</p>
			<p class="indent">Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sowing Teeth.</em></strong> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Implanting Teeth.</em></strong> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Recovering Teeth.</em></strong> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Teeth.</em></strong> Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.</p>

			<p>Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tieflings, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.</p>

			<p>Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art—the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: “Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. And among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat—the greatest of dragons—as two of the song’s first singers.</p>

		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.</p>
			<p class="indent">Paladins who follow the Watchers’ oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one’s surroundings is as natural as wearing armor in battle.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of the Watchers</h5>
			<p>A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers swears to safeguard mortal realms from otherworldly threats.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vigilance.</em></strong> The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Loyalty.</em></strong> Never accept gifts or favors from friends or those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, your comrades, and your duty.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Discipline.</em></strong> You are the shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.</p>

Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.</p>

				<p>A Swarmkeeper’s swarm and spells are reflections of the character’s bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger’s magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don’t change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character’s narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3.</p>
				<p class="indent">Also, remember that the swarm’s appearance is yours to customize, and don’t feel confined to a single appearance. Perhaps the spirits’ look changes with the ranger’s mood or with the seasons. You decide!</p>

In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard’s confidant and right hand.

			<p>Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves’ tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves’ guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.</p>
			<p class="indent">Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal guardians of their woods. In the endless war among the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a Soulknife when stealth is required against the githyanki foe.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.</p>

			<p>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).</p>

You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Psychic Whispers.</em></strong> You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die.

			<p>You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs on the Elemental Planes and have great influence over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble genies are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals, who often bind genies into servitude, and readily enter into pacts that expand their reach.</p>

			<p><em>1st-level The Genie feature</em></p>
			<p>Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the genie’s power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie’s Vessel table.</p>

			<p>While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bottled Respite.</em></strong> As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is comfortably appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel’s former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can’t enter again until you finish a long rest. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Genie’s Wrath.</em></strong> Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).</p>
			<p>The vessel’s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.</p>

			<p>Magic of the book—that’s what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It’s rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.</p>
			<p class="indent">Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!</p>
