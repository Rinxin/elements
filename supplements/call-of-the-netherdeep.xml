			<html>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An epic Critical Role campaign for the world’s greatest roleplaying game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greed of mortals has awakened a powerful entity long thought destroyed. For eons, this mighty champion of the gods has been imprisoned in the darkest depths of Exandria. His name has been forgotten, as have his heroic deeds. Languishing in despair, he calls out for new heroes to save him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the campaigns of the hit series Critical Role, this adventure begins in the Wastes of Xhorhas and leads to the glimmering oasis-city of Ank’Harel on the continent of Marquet, and from there into a sunken realm of gloom, corruption, and sorrow known as the Netherdeep. Above it all, the red moon of Ruidus watches, twisting the fates of those who have the power to shape the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep contains seven chapters of thrilling adventure, new creatures and magic items, and a poster map of Ank’Harel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First major adventure module within Critical Role’s world of Exandria, taking players from levels 3-12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-continental story that spans the scarred Wastes of Xhorhas, introduces the continent of Marquet, and eventually plunges players into the Netherdeep—a terrifying cross between the Far Realm and the deep ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bursting with lore and all new art depicting Exandria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes new magic items and creatures and introduces new rival NPCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;The Jewel of Three Prayers is a Vestige of Divergence (see the "Vestiges of Divergence" sidebar). In ancient times, Alyxian the Apotheon bore this amulet as a symbol of his covenant with three Prime Deities: Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart. When the jewel is found, only Sehanine's power thrums within its dormant heart. The power of the other two deities waits to be reawakened by a hero—or heroes—who can follow in Alyxian's footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dormant State.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In this state, the Jewel of Three Prayers is a glittering golden disk attached to a fine golden chain. The chain magically resizes to function as a necklace for the creature that wears it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In its Dormant State, the jewel has the following properties: You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the jewel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While wearing or holding the jewel, you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you extinguish it (no action required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The jewel has 3 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the jewel, you can expend 1 charge from it to cast the invisibility spell.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can expend 1 of the jewel's charges as a reaction to enable that creature to reroll the saving throw, potentially turning a failure into a success. The creature must use the new roll.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Each of your allies within 30 feet of you gains the ability to breathe water and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the jewel's charges to target yourself or one willing creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 15 feet of yourself, along with any equipment the target is wearing or carrying. The target appears in a flash of golden radiance, and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target's new location must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

	<element name="Teleportation Tablet" type="Magic Item" source="Call of the Netherdeep" id="ID_WOTC_COTN_MAGIC_ITEM_TELEPORTATION_TABLET">
		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;This clay tablet is eight inches long, four inches wide, and half an inch thick. Inscribed on it is the sigil sequence for a permanent teleportation circle. A creature that studies the sequence for 10 minutes can make a DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana) check, learning the circle's destination on a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You can use an action to break the tablet in half, turning it to dust. If the tablet is broken while it is on the same plane of existence as the teleportation circle whose sigil sequence was engraved on it, a 10-foot-diameter teleportation circle of glowing blue light appears on the ground in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of you. This teleportation circle has the characteristics of one created using the teleportation circle spell, except that it connects to the teleportation circle whose sigil sequence appears on the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The teleportation circle created by the tablet disappears at the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

	<element name="Ruidium Corruption" type="Information" source="Call of the Netherdeep" id="ID_WOTC_COTN_INFORMATION_RUIDIUM_CORRUPTION">
		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;When a creature is at risk of becoming corrupted, it must make a Charisma saving throw. The save DC varies based on the ruidium's virulence. On a failed saving throw, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion (see the Player's Handbook) and becomes corrupted if it isn't already. From that point on, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage whenever its level of exhaustion increases or decreases by 1, until it's no longer corrupted (see "Ending Corruption" below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SIGNS OF CORRUPTION&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first physical sign of corruption in a creature is a bright red rash, which appears on the creature's body where it made contact with the ruidium. As the creature's level of exhaustion increases, the signs of corruption become more obvious, as summarized in the Physical Signs of Ruidium Corruption table. Decreasing a creature's level of exhaustion doesn't affect the physical signs of corruption. Once a new physical sign appears, it can't be removed from the creature until its ruidium corruption is ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;PHYSICAL SIGNS OF RUIDIUM CORRUPTION&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center col-25"&gt;Exhaustion Level&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Physical Signs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A red rash appears, originating from the point of contact with ruidium.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pulsing crimson veins spread across the creature's skin.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crimson blisters and boils appear on the creature's skin.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stubby spurs of ruidium crystal protrude from the creature's body.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The creature's crystal protrusions grow larger and more grotesque.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="center"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The corruption kills the creature.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A creature beset by ruidium corruption also exhibits emotional signs of corruption that worsen as its level of exhaustion increases. These symptoms include amplified feelings of regret, yearning, rage, and despair. A player whose character is corrupted by ruidium can roleplay these symptoms however they wish. (For example, the player could emphasize or amplify their character's flaw, or choose a new flaw for their character.) As with the physical signs of corruption, all emotional symptoms persist until the creature's ruidium corruption is ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="sidebar"&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;RUIDIUM SPELL COMPONENTS&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One ounce of ruidium can be substituted for 500 gp worth of any material component needed to cast a spell. A creature that casts a spell using ruidium as a replacement component must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion after the spell is cast. If the creature isn't already suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted if it fails the saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ENDING CORRUPTION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a wish spell or divine intervention can cure a creature's ruidium corruption; simply removing all levels of exhaustion from the creature cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Ruidium and the effects of its corruption vanish from the world if the Apotheon is redeemed at the end of this adventure (see "Best Ending: A World that Remembered" in chapter 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When ruidium corruption ends on a creature, all physical and emotional signs of it disappear from the creature instantly.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
