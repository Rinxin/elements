        <description>
            <p>You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and his or her descendants. This spell does not require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you used when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target’s next oldest offspring.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Ritual Focus.</b> If you expend your ritual focus, the curse becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.  </p>
            <p class="indent">Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.  </p>
            <p class="indent">Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.  </p>
            <p class="indent">The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.</p>
			<p class="indent">The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including a wall of force.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create a tiny black hole at a point you can see within range. The black hole is a sphere with a 15-foot radius. All fires and flames within 40 feet of the black hole—magical or otherwise—are instantly extinguished. Each creature within 40 feet of the black hole when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d6 force damage and is pulled to within 5 feet of the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is knocked prone but isn’t pulled toward the black hole.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that’s within 5 feet of the black hole at the start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 8d6 force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature that’s within 40 feet of the black hole (but not within 5 feet of it) at the end of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while within 5 feet of the black hole dies immediately.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you designate a creature within range and convert its blood into virulent acid. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d12 acid damage and is stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures without blood, such as constructs and plants, are not affected by this spell. If blood to acid is cast on a creature composed mainly of blood, such as a blood elemental or a blood zombie (Creature Codex, p. 393), the creature is slain by the spell if its saving throw fails.</p>

            <p>You create a 10-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius cylinder of destructive energy around a point you can see within range. The area is difficult terrain. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant. Each creature or object that is inside the cylinder when it’s created or ends its turn inside the cylinder takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature or object dropped to 0 hit points by the spell is reduced to fine ash.</p>
            <p class="indent">The cylinder’s radius expands by 20 feet at the start of each of your turns after the spell is cast. Any creatures or objects enveloped in the enlarged area are subject to its effects immediately.</p>

            <p>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration. The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains. When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.</p>

            <p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check.

        <description>
            <p>You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 100 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 15d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 4d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 100 feet of the seal.</p>
            <p class="indent">The seal has AC 18, 75 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if the seal itself is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

            <p>You summon a cylindrical sinkhole filled with burning ash and grasping arms made of molten metal at a point on the ground you can see within range. The sinkhole is 20 feet deep and 50 feet in diameter, and is difficult terrain. A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast, or that begins its turn in the area or enters it during its turn, takes 10d6 fire damage and must make a Strength or Dexterity (creature’s choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the molten arms, which try to drag it below the surface of the ash.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that’s restrained by the arms at the start of your turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet farther down into the ash. A creature pulled below the surface is blinded, deafened, and can’t breathe. To escape, a creature must use an action to make a successful Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature is no longer restrained and can move through the difficult terrain of the ash pit. It doesn’t need to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw this turn to not be grabbed by the arms again, but it must make the saving throw as normal if it’s still in the ash pit at the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">The diameter of the ash pit increases by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. The ash pit remains after the spell ends, but the grasping arms disappear and restrained creatures are freed automatically. As the ash slowly cools, it deals 1d6 less fire damage for each hour that passes after the spell ends.</p>

            <p>You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or half the target’s level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can’t be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can’t speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. Antimagic field has no effect on the wall, and dispel magic can affect only the violet layer.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1. Red.</i></b>The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2. Orange.</i></b>The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3. Yellow.</i></b>The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4. Green.</i></b>The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5. Blue.</i></b>The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6. Indigo.</i></b>On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7. Violet.</i></b>On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</p>

            <p>You point toward an area of ground or a similar surface within range. A geyser of lava erupts from the chosen spot. The geyser is 5 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. Each creature in the cylinder when it erupts or at the start of your turn takes 10d8 fire damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">The geyser also forms a pool of lava at its base. Initially, the pool is the same size as the geyser, but at the start of each of your turns for the duration, the pool’s radius increases by 5 feet. A creature in the pool of lava (but not in the geyser) at the start of your turn takes 5d8 fire damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature leaves the pool of lava, its speed is reduced by half and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, caused by a hardening layer of lava. These penalties last until the creature uses an action to break the hardened stone away from itself.</p>

            <p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point that you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any non-magical items it is wearing or carrying.</p>

            <p>You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature, If the creature has the same proficiency as you, and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit pints than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</p>

            <p>This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it’s holding, falls prone, becomes incapacitated, and can’t move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed.</p>
            <p class="indent">All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as flaming sphere. A creature under the influence of a freedom of movement spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated.</p>

            <p class="indent">A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Round 2.</i></b> Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.</p>

Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You summon a worldly incarnation of a Great Old One, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. This avatar manifests as an emanation of elder darkness, augmented by boons from the Void. Choose one of the following options for the type of avatar that appears. (Other options might be available if the GM allows.) An asterisk indicates a spell described in this section.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Avatar of Cthulhu.</em> The incarnation is a deep one (Tome of Beasts, p. 73) that can innately cast command and sleep of the deep* at will.</li>
                <li><em>Avatar of Nyarlathotep.</em> The incarnation is a dark voice (Creature Codex, p. 73) that can innately cast bane and semblance of dread* at will.</li>
                <li><em>Avatar of Shub-Niggurath.</em> The incarnation is a goat-man (Tome of Beasts, p. 231) that can innately cast Black Goat’s blessing* and unseen strangler* at will.</li>
                <li><em>Avatar of Yog-Sothoth.</em> The incarnation is a human with 1d4 + 1 flesh warps that can innately cast gift of resilience* (see page 71) and thunderwave at will.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">When the avatar appears, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the avatar is friendly to you and your allies. On a failed save, the avatar is friendly to no one and attacks the nearest creature, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent">Roll initiative for the avatar, which takes its own turns. If it is friendly to you, it obeys verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you). If the avatar has no command, it attacks the nearest creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each round when you maintain concentration on the spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short-term madness. The same penalty recurs when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long.</p>
            <p class="indent">The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating before 1 hour has elapsed, the avatar becomes uncontrolled and hostile until it disappears 1d6 rounds later or until it is killed.</p>

            <p>You create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area of the storm 30 feet in any direction.</p>

            <p>You cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of a stone golem. It takes a turn immediately after your turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem to move and attack, provided you’re within 60 feet of it. Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it’s destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a normal, mundane statue.</p>

            <p>You designate a creature within range that has the Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine what slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast that particular spell at that particular time.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled magic spell does not end.</p>

            <p>You speak a hideous string of Void Speech that leaves your mouth bloodied, causing a rift into nothingness to tear open. The rift takes the form of a 10-foot-radius sphere, and it forms around a point you can see within range. The area within 40 feet of the sphere’s outer edge becomes difficult terrain as the Void tries to draw everything into itself. A creature that starts its turn within 40 feet of the sphere or that enters that area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 15 feet toward the rift. A creature that starts its turn in the rift or that comes into contact with it for the first time on its turn takes 8d10 necrotic damage. Creatures inside the rift are blinded and deafened. Unattended objects within 40 feet of the rift are drawn 15 feet toward it at the start of your turn, and they take damage as creatures if they come into contact with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">While concentrating on the spell, you take 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of your turns.</p>

            <p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>
                <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li>
                <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>
                <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.</li>
                <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.</p>
            <p class="indent">The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>
