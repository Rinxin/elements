		<description>
			<p>A timekeeper uses seconds and minutes not as a way to measure life but as the key to great and mysterious power. The tradition of the timekeepers began in the magocracies of the West prior to the Great Mage Wars. Many timekeepers find themselves responsible for keeping watch over the dread walkers of the Wastes, to ensure they are never freed from stasis. Others seek to rediscover the lost spells and rituals that allowed long-gone mages to halt the dread walkers in the first place.</p>
			<p class="indent">Except as noted below, timekeepers function as wizards and use the wizard spell list. A timekeeper has the following class features.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, you can choose to ignore environmental time effects such as those created by a time storm or a time rift.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, you can spend temporal points in the following ways.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 temporal points to reduce the casting time for this casting to 1 bonus action.</li>
				<li>When you must make a saving throw against slow or any temporal spell, you can spend 2 temporal points to succeed on the saving throw automatically. You can make the decision to spend the points after rolling the die and seeing the result.</li>
				<li>As a reaction when another creature casts time stop, you can spend 5 temporal points to act during the spell’s duration. You and the spell’s original caster alternate taking turns, with the original caster acting first. You have the same restrictions as the original caster. If the original caster ends the spell, it ends for everyone; if you take an action that ends the spell, it ends only for you, not for the original caster.</li>
