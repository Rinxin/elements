                <description>
                    <p>As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.</p>

                    <p>When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>

Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. </p>

                    <p>The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a disguise kit enables its owner to adopt a false identity.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Components.</em></strong> A disguise kit includes cosmetics, hair dye, small props, and a few pieces of clothing.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Deception.</em></strong> In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Intimidation.</em></strong> The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Performance.</em></strong> A cunning disguise can enhance an audience’s enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired reaction.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Persuasion.</em></strong> Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Create Disguise.</em></strong> As part of a long rest, you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it. You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have a bag of holding or a similar method to keep them hidden. Each disguise weighs 1 pound.</p>
                    <p class="indent">At other times, it takes 10 minutes to craft a disguise that involves moderate changes to your appearance, and 30 minutes for one that requires more extensive changes.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>A forgery kit is designed to duplicate documents and to make it easier to copy a person’s seal or signature.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Components.</em></strong> A forgery kit includes several different types of ink, a variety of parchments and papers, several quills, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and small tools to sculpt melted wax to mimic a seal.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Arcana.</em></strong> A forgery kit can be used in conjunction with the Arcana skill to determine if a magic item is real or fake.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Deception.</em></strong> A well crafted forgery, such as papers proclaiming you to be a noble or a writ that grants you safe passage, can lend credence to a lie.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>History.</em></strong> A forgery kit combined with your knowledge of history improves your ability to create fake historical documents or to tell if an old document is authentic.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Investigation.</em></strong> When you examine objects, proficiency with a forgery kit is useful for determining how an object was made and whether it is genuine.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Other Tools.</em></strong> Knowledge of other tools makes your forgeries that much more believable. For example, you could combine proficiency with a forgery kit and proficiency with cartographer’s tools to make a fake map.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Quick Fake.</em></strong> As part of a short rest, you can produce a forged document no more than one page in length. As part of a long rest, you can produce a document that is up to four pages long. Your Intelligence check using a forgery kit determines the DC for someone else’s Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot the fake.</p>

                    <p>While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>

                    <p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <em>dancing lights</em> and <em>light</em> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.</p>

                    <p>Made by the drow, this rod is a magic weapon that ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p>

It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).</p>
                    <p class="indent">When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.</p>

                    <p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Six Buttons.</em></strong> You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a <em>flame tongue</em>, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Drain Life.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Paralyze.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Terrify.</em></strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

                    <p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lightning.</em></strong> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thunder.</em></strong> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lightning Strike.</em></strong> You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff’s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thunderclap.</em></strong> You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thunder and Lightning.</em></strong> You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Absorption.</em></strong> While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level. However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <em>conjure elemental</em> (7 charges), <em>dispel magic</em> (3 charges), <em>fireball</em> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <em>flaming sphere</em> (2 charges), <em>ice storm</em> (4 charges), <em>invisibility</em> (2 charges), <em>knock</em> (2 charges), <em>lightning bolt</em> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <em>passwall</em> (5 charges), <em>plane shift</em> (7 charges), <em>telekinesis</em> (5 charges), <em>wall of fire</em> (4 charges), or <em>web</em> (2 charges).</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: <em>arcane lock</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>enlarge reduce</em>, <em>light</em>, <em>mage hand</em>, or <em>protection from evil and good</em>.</p>	
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Retributive Strike.</em></strong> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.

                <description>
                    <p>This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.</p>

                    <p>This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>An <em>arrow of slaying</em> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both <em>arrows of dragon slaying</em> and <em>arrows of blue dragon slaying</em>. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an <em>arrow of slaying</em> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Once an <em>arrow of slaying</em> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as <em>bolts of slaying</em> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

                    <p>This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs ½ pound.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.</li>
                        <li>"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.</li>
                        <li>"Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.</li>

                <description>
                    <p>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.  When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.</p>

                    <p class="indent">When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The <em>lesser restoration</em> spell can also end the effect on a creature.</p>

                    <p>Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.</p>
                    <p>The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.</p>

                    <p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Silver Raven (Uncommon).</em></strong> This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the <em>animal messenger</em> spell on it at will.</p>

                    <p>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>
                        <li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
                        <li>The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>

                    <p>This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs ½ pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 <em>beads of force</em> are found together.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the <em>knock</em> spell and similar magic, such as that of a <em>chime of opening</em>.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a <em>wish</em> spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of <em>wish</em> causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.</p>

                    <p>You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>
                        <li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>
                        <li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <em>+1 lance</em>, and the other becomes <em>+2 longsword</em>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form.  In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form.  The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>

                <description>
                    <p>This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>
                    <p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The third command word causes the <em>folding boat</em> to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.</p>

            <element name="Heward’s Handy Haversack" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_HEWARDS_HANDY_HAVERSACK">
                <description>
                    <p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>bag of holding</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound.  You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to unfold a <em>portable hole</em> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the <em>portable hole</em> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <em>portable hole</em> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>bag of holding</em>, <em>handy haversack</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Anchor.</em></strong> You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bird.</em></strong> You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.  The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fan.</em></strong> If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Swan Boat.</em></strong> You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Tree.</em></strong> You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Whip.</em></strong> You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.</p>
                    <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.</p>

                    <p class="indent">A <em>light</em> spell cast on the robe or a <em>daylight</em> spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for <em>light</em> or DC 15 for <em>daylight</em>), ending the blindness on a success.</p>

                    <p class="indent">You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This bag superficially resembles a <em>bag of holding</em> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>

                    <p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: <em>daylight</em> (opal), <em>fireball</em> (fire opal),	 <em>prismatic spray</em> (diamond), or <em>wall of fire</em> (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>

                    <p>Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it.  It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.  Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>

                    <p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features -- such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons -- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p>

                    <p>This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn.

In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The apparatus of the crab is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong>Armor Class</strong>: 20</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>
                    <p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.  The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the Gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Balance.</em></strong> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Comet.</em></strong> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Donjon.</em></strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.  You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.  You can't be located by any divination magic, but a <em>wish</em> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Euryale.</em></strong> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Fates.</em></strong> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Flames.</em></strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fool.</em></strong> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gem.</em></strong> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Idiot.</em></strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Jester.</em></strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Key.</em></strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Knight.</em></strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Moon.</em></strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <em>wish</em> spell 1d3 times.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rogue.</em></strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a				<em>wish</em> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ruin.</em></strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Skull.</em></strong> You summon an avatar of death -- a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>
                    <h1>Avatar of Death</h1>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Star.</em></strong> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sun.</em></strong> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Talons.</em></strong> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Throne.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vizier.</em></strong> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>The Void.</em></strong> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A <em>wish</em> spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An <em>identify</em> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.</p>

Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of <em>universal solvent</em> or <em>oil of etherealness</em>, or with a <em>wish</em> spell.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <em>gate</em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a <em>portable hole</em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.</p>
                    <table>

                            <tr><td>86-00</td><td>A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.</td></tr>

                    <p>This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.</p>

                    <p>This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expend in a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.</p>

                    <p>An <em>Ioun stone</em> is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of <em>Ioun stone</em> exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</p>

Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>

                    <p>This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>

                    <p>Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents undead from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that an undead would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An undead can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the undead ceases to be affected by the barrier.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.</p>
                    <p class="indent">To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery’s instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
                        <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
                        <li>1 major detrimental property</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p class="indent">The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.</p> 
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>The Sum of its Parts.</i></b> Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:</p> 
                    <ul class="unstyled">
                        <li><em>The chronolometer</em></li>
                        <li><em>The dimensional loop</em></li>
                        <li><em>The far gear</em></li>
                        <li><em>The Rotor of Return</em></li>
                        <li><em>The timepiece of travel</em></li>
                        <li><em>The wheel of stars</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p class="indent">Creatures can attune to the orrery’s components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn’t count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.</p> 
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Future Echoes.</i></b> With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a + 1 bonus to AC.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Into the Void.</i></b> With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms.</p> 
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Master of Travel.</i></b> While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): <em>contact other plane</em> (3 charges), <em>demiplane</em> (6 charges), <em>gate</em> (7 charges), <em>plane shift</em> (5 charges), or <em>teleportation circle</em> (3 charges).

                <description>
                    <p class="flavor">Through the winter clouds that surround the castle on this desolate hill, you see a shape emerge. Something so gigantic, you can’t believe it can actually fly.</p>
                    <p>Airships are relatively rare in Acquisitions Incorporated, which is thought to hold no more than five in its fleet. But the unparalleled usefulness of these craft in commerce—and in combat—makes the company-standard battle balloon a much-coveted upgrade for any franchise.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Origins and Operations.</i></b> Professional secrecy and aggressive marketing make it unclear where the airship originated. Some say battle balloons were an original design created by the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development department of Acquisitions Incorporated. But the wizards of Halruaa developed similar skyships in ages past, and the Cult of the Dragon has been seen with flying ships of its own. Still, among the small number of factions and organizations known to possess or build airships. Acquisitions Incorporated might be the best known for its high-profile aerial escapades. It’s certain that neither the mages of Halruaa nor the members of the Cult of the Dragon ever crewed a battle balloon with keg robots, or used one to squash a tyrannosaurus flat.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Flying Battle Vehicle.</i></b> The standard design of an Acquisitions Incorporated-grade airship features an enormous balloon covered in a rope net. Trailing lines connect the balloon to the vessel of metal and wood suspended below. In the center of the deck, directly below the balloon, sits a large magic furnace, whose formidable lifting power is rumored to involve trapped elementals. The airship’s captain controls the arcane furnace and directs forward thrust by way of a propeller located at the back of the ship, helming the craft with a wheel positioned in the bow. Metal runners below the ship allow a battle balloon to land on the ground.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Options and Armaments.</i></b> Each franchise or organization customizes the offensive capability of its airships, but most battle balloons feature multiple harpoon guns, perfect for fighting and snaring aerial threats. Battle balloons that see a lot of combat are typically well stocked with other ranged weapons and polearms for ship-to-ship and crew-to-crew fighting.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Whether privately financed or loaned out by Head Office under extraordinarily cautious terms, battle balloons can be customized with unique equipment—different siege weapons, lifting and cargo gear, and so forth—to make each airship unique. However, the most potent weapon featured on most Acquisitions Incorporated battle balloons is the green flame arbalester, a massive ballista whose bolts pulse with arcane power and detonate with formidable explosive force wherever they hit.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Mobile Franchise Headquarters.</i></b> battle balloon is perhaps the most sought-after of the mobile headquarters options available to Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. The versatility of an airship allows for the rapid shipping of goods, mercenaries, and loot. Such a vessel also allows a quick escape from sticky developments and deals gone bad.</p>

                    <p class="flavor">When you hear the mechanical beholder click to life, it sounds like death itself snapping its fingers.</p>
                    <p>A mechanical beholder takes the form of an oversized eye tyrant whose central eye is a viewport window. Part conveyance, part laboratory, and part siege engine, the vehicle can transport up to six humanoids through any terrain or medium, including underwater and through solid stone. A complex and often dangerous manipulation of gears, levers, and buttons controlled the original mechanical beholders, but more recent models feature magical controls that respond to voice commands though not always accurately.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Equipment and Options.</i></b> The mechanical beholder can be outfitted with a variety of sensors, probes, and gauges, allowing for functions as varied as determining alchemical composition, picking up on magical auras, or making masterfully dry martinis. Its range of armaments includes a disintegration ray modeled after that of its monstrous namesake (which for reasons of liability is advertised as being designed exclusively for waste removal). Portholes and hatches allow characters inside the beholder to make ranged and magical attacks from within it.</p>

Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable. If the characters acquire the Tome of Strahd and want to read these paragraphs, show the players the "From the Tome of Strahd" section in appendix F.</p>
                <p class="indent">If Strahd sees, or learns from a minion, that the tome has fallen into the party's possession, all of his other objectives (see chapter 1, "Into the Mists") are put on hold until the book is recovered. When Strahd attacks, his preferred target is whoever has the tome.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first <em>blood spear</em>, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vampiric Strike.</em></strong> The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter· 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blight Bane.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The Holy Symbol of Raven kind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven-or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.</p>
                <p class="indent">The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.</p>
                <p class="indent">The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hold Vampires.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> If you have the-Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sunlight.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).</p>

            <description>
                <p>The Icon of Raven loft is a 12-inch-tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.</p>
                <p class="indent">The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.</p>
                <p class="indent">While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a protection from evil and good spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Augury.</em></strong> You can use an action to cast an <em>augury</em> spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of the Undead.</em></strong> You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cure Wounds.</em></strong> While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Saint Markovia's thighbone has the properties of a mace of disruption. If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.</p>
                <p class="indent">Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.</p>
                <p class="indent">Suffused with confidence born of righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.</p>
                <p class="indent">The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The <em>Sunsword</em> is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.</p>
                <p class="indent">Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.</p>
                <p class="indent">The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a <em>sun blade</em>.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Sunsword</em> is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The <em>Sunsword</em>'s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.</p>

In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.</p>
                <p class="indent">The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast <em>dominate monster</em> (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that’s not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you are not a devil, using the helm’s <em>dominate monster</em> property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent change of attracting a narzugon (see page 238), which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours.

            <description>
                <p>An <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. <em>Infernal puzzle box</em> are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty <em>infernal puzzle box</em> weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.</p>
                <p class="indent">When an object small enough to fit inside an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is placed in it, the container magically sealed shut around the object, and no magic can forced the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular <em>infernal puzzle box</em>, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box’s contents.</p>
                <p class="indent">A creature that spends 1 hour hiding an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

            <description>
                <p>A narzugon devil binds a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) to its service with <em>infernal tack</em>, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, withing 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.</p>
                <p class="indent">The tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.</p>

        <element name="Shield of the Hidden Lord" type="Magic Item" source="Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus" id="ID_WOCT_BGDIA_MAGIC_ITEM_SHIELD_OF_THE_HIDDEN_LORD">
            <description>
                <p>The <em>Shield of the Hidden Lord</em> is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth’s evil has warped the shield’s appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.</p>
                <p class="indent">While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Shield of the Hidden Lord</em> is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.</li>
                    <li>The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.</li>
                    <li>The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast <em>fireball</em> or 2 charges to cast <em>wall of fire</em> from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The <em>wall of fire</em> spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</li>
                    <li>Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can’t use it again until the next dawn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gargauth’s Personality.</em></strong> Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can’t escape on its own. The pit fiend won’t reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.</p>
                <p class="indent">While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield’s current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual’s soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield’s owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.</p>
                <p class="indent">Gargauth doesn’t know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it’s brought to the Nine Hells, for it’s convinced that the shield’s powers are weaker there.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Freeing Gargauth.</em></strong> Casting <em>dispel evil and good</em> on the shield has a 1 percent change of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth’s name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.</p>

        <element name="Soul Coin" type="Magic Item" source="Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus" id="ID_WOCT_BGDIA_MAGIC_ITEM_SOUL_COIN">
            <description>
                <p><em>Soul coins</em> are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each <em>soul coin</em> has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag’s curse.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Carrying Soul Coins.</em></strong> To hold a <em>soul coin</em> is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.</p>
                <p class="indent">An evil creature can carry as many <em>soul coins</em> as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of <em>soul coins</em> equal to or less than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Using a Soul Coin.</em></strong> A <em>soul coin</em> has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a <em>soul coin</em> and use it to do one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drain Life.</strong> You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query.</strong> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more that a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Freeing a Soul.</em></strong> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a <em>soul coin</em> frees the soul trapped within it, and does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from <em>soul coins</em> typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.</p>
                <p class="indent">A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A <em>soul coin</em> has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a <em>hellfire weapon</em> or an infernal war machine’s furnace.</p>
                <p class="indent">Freeing a soul from a <em>soul coin</em> is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hellish Currency.</em></strong><em>Soul coins</em> are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.</p>
                <p class="indent"><em>Soul coins</em> are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p>

                <p>This longsword belong to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace. Fashioned from celestial steel, it gives off a faint glow and hum. The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can’t. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Attunement.</em></strong> The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. You alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:</p>

                <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword’s light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties, each determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Searing Radiance.</em></strong> The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you’re wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Sword of Zariel</em> is a sentient lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Truth Seer.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Sword.</em></strong> Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn’t bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it’s used to shatter the Companion, unless the blade is wielded by and angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy that a normal longsword.</p>

                <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The sword has the following random properties:</p>
                <ul>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ruler of Avernus.</em></strong> As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Infernal recall.</em></strong> As an action, you can use the sword to cast <em>word of recall</em>. Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Sword.</em></strong> The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q’barra and Xen’drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls fl.owing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust’s market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools-such as the lightning rail and elemental airships-require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding-which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleonsrequires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.</p>

                <p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen’drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>

                <p class="indent">The crown regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

            <description>
                <p>A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Life Support.</em></strong> Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> A docent has the following properties:</p>
                <ul class="unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Languages.</strong> The docent knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skills.</strong> The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a d4): (1) Arcana, (2) History, (3) Investigation, or (4) Nature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spells.</strong> The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a d6): (1-2) detect evil and good or (3-6) detect magic. The docent decides when to cast the spell.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it’s attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent’s properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.</p>

                <p>This long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for the entire attunement period, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbiotic Nature.</em></strong> The whip can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The earworm has 4 charges.

In addition, the holder (who needn’t be attuned to the item) can take an action to end any one spell tied to it, provided the holder knows the command word you set for ending the tied spells.

                <p>The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis’s network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you’re a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.</p>

                <p>This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that’s no more than 320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.</p>
                <p class="indent">While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.</p>

                <p class="indent">As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the gust of wind spell (spell save DC 15) with no components. This property of the lungs can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</p>
                    <ul class="unstyled">
                        <li><strong>Acid Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fire Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frost Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lightning Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</li>
                        <li><strong>Poison Spray.</strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

                    <p class="indent">If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.</p>

This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon.</p>

                    <p>This onyx sphere bears deep, spiraling grooves and dangles from an iron chain. While the orb is on your person, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.</li>
                        <li>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the orb increases its range by 60 feet.</li>
                        <li>You have advantage on Wisdom checks to find hidden doors and paths.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> The orb is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times. All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you automatically extinguish, and fire damage dealt by you is halved.</p>

                    <p>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>A roun, blue fruit roughly the size of a plum, a dyolet is known for its sweet flavor and the mild surge of energy granted to whoever eats it. Dyolets can also be imbued with minor healing abilities, a property kept secret by the gnomes of the Velvin Thicket until recent years. Herbalists and apothecaries can imbue healing within the fruit for a fraction of the time and gold cost of brewing a potion. A dyolet can be imbued with one of the following properties by a character proficient with a healer’s kit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can saturate the fruit with carefully brewed curative draughts to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of healing. This process takes 12 hours and costs 15 gp.</li>
                        <li>You can saturate the fruit with strengthened restorative properties to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of greater healing. This process takes 4 days and costs 70 gp.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can consume a dyolet as an action to gain its healing effect. A dyolet lasts up to 20 days after being harvested before it begins to rot. A rotting dyolet loses its healing properties.</p>

The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain a round their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours. For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion-an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>As an action, a creature can throw a vial of frigid woe up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact and releasing its contents as a cloud of spores. Each creature within 5 feet of the vial when it shatters must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see the “Eiselcross” section of chapter 3).</p>
                    <p class="indent">If a character has contracted frigid woe, track the number of days that have passed so you can inform the player when their character’s symptoms appear and when they need to make Constitution saving throws.</p>
                    <div class="sidebar">
                        <h5>Frigid Woe</h5>
                        <p>Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor’s mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross’s ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.</p>
                        <p class="indent">The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor’s mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature’s body. The infected creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature’s speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.</p>
                        <p class="indent">A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.</p>

                    <p>Several of these spellbooks with gilded pages and silver-plated covers were created during the Age of Arcanum, but only one has been found since the Calamity ended.

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> Most of the book is blank, but the following spells are recorded in the first pages of the tome: alarm, antimagic field, Bigby’s hand, blight, charm person, confusion, control weather, create undead, detect thoughts, enlarge/reduce, fear, foresight, gaseous form, glyph of warding, legend lore, Leomund’s tiny hut, mass suggestion, mislead, misty step, Mordenkainen’s faithful hound, prismatic spray, ray of enfeeblement, silent image, teleport, and thunderwave.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can use the grimoire as your spellbook, and you can scribe new spells into it as normal. When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire, the number of wizard spells you can prepare increases by 1.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The Infiltrator’s Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The key can be used as thieves’ tools for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in thieves’ tools and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.</li>
                        <li>While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When the Infiltrator’s Key reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.</li>
                        <li>While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: alter self, invisibility, knock, or pass without trace. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Exalted.</em></strong> When the Infiltrator’s Key reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a bonus action, you can touch the key to a floor, wall, or ceiling that is no more than 5 feet thick and cause a magical opening to appear in the surface. When you create the opening, you choose its length and width, up to 10 feet for each dimension. The opening lasts until the key passes through it to the other side, at which point it disappears (if a creature is in the opening when the doorway closes, the creature is safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space). The key can’t be used to create another opening until the next dawn.</li>
                        <li>While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: dimension door, gaseous form, or mislead. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.</li>

                    <p>A Stormgirdle is a wide belt made of thick leather branded with the symbol of Kord. The girdle’s clasps are made from dragon ivory.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> While wearing the Stormgirdle in its dormant state, you have resistance to lightning damage and thunder damage, and your Strength score becomes 21 if it isn’t already 21 or higher.

                    <ul>
                        <li>You have immunity to lightning damage and thunder damage.</li>

                        <li>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to be struck by lightning. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This spear is made from the ivory bone of an ancient gold dragon and carved with an Orc hymn to Gruumsh.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Ruin’s Wake is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 22. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Orc.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A slaughter-loving balor named Yarrowish lives within Ruin’s Wake. The weapon desires only to draw blood and pushes its wielder to solve problems with violence.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc.</li>
                        <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d8 piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand.</li>
                        <li>As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with Ruin’s Wake with advantage against the attacker. You can’t use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When the spear reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra piercing damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d8.</li>
                        <li>When you hurl the spear and speak a command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Each creature in the line, excluding you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Ruin’s Wake then returns to your hand. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Exalted.</em></strong> When the spear reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.</li>
                        <li>While holding the spear, you can let out a battle cry as a bonus action. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you gains advantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                        <li>When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack from the spear, you can regain hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the attack. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>

It demands that its wielder take decisive action to keep order in high-pressure situations—and to always take a fair share of treasure in return.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>

                        <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
                        <li>As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                        <li>While holding the war pick, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Pick a damage type from the Will of the Talon Breath Weapons table. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a DC 13 saving throw, the type of which is specified in the table. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>

            <element name="Hollow One" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_HOLLOW_ONE">
                <description>
                    <p>The eastern coast of Xhorhas, known to the Kryn as Blightshore, is a land scarred by evil magic. Among the creations of that foul place are the Hollow Ones, beings whose souls have left for the afterlife, yet whose bodies still retain a fragment of their former selves.</p>			
                    <p class="indent">The magic that sustains Hollow Ones is a mystery. Most Hollow Ones are reborn after dying in Blightshore, suggesting that the spell-scared nature of the land brought them back for an unknown purpose. Yet some being find that, days after they died, they awaken, clutching to life, with only a terrible emptiness inside to remind them of their death.</p>			
                    <p class="indent">In Blightshore, Hollow Ones are seen as people like any other. They seem strange, but the adventurous and hardy folk of Blightshore are used to making allies with strange creatures. Elsewhere, Hollow Ones are indistinguishable from living creatures, save for the faint stench of necromancy that lingers about them.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The transition from life to becoming a Hollow One affects different people to different degrees. Some let their anger and regret consume them. Others use their second chance to become a brighter force in the world. However, all Hollow Ones are marked by their new existence: feelings of unease, dread, or sadness cling to them like tattered rags of their past life.</p>
                    <p>The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in a Wildemount campaign to be a Hollow One. Alternatively, a character who perishes in the course of a campaign might return as a Hollow One, created by the mysterious forces that scar the land.</p>
                    <p class="indent">As a Hollow One, the void left behind by your departed soul is filled with the strange magic of Blightshore. Becoming a Hollow One is a supernatural gift that bestows upon you the following traits.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ageless.</em></strong> You don’t age, and effects that would cause you to age don’t work on you.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cling to Life.</em></strong> When you make a death saving throw and roll 16 or higher, you regain 1 hit point.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Revenance.</em></strong> You retain your creature type, yet you register as undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the undead creature type.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Unsettling Presence.</em></strong> As an action, you can unsettle a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes within the next minute. Constructs, undead, and creatures that can’t be frightened are immune to this feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

The shark can deal damage in this way no more that once per hour.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates, bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium, all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus. In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared. The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.</p>
                <p class="indent">You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.</p>
                <p class="indent">On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.</p>

                <p>This thick, black paint is stored in a small jar, containing enough paint to apply moodmarks to one creature. The paint is dabbed on the face in spots or markings that often resemble the eyes of insects or spiders. Applying the paint in this way takes 1 minute.</p>
                <p class="indent">For the next 8 hours, the marks change to reflect your mental state. A creature that can see you and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can discern whether you are happy, sad, angry, disgusted, surprised, or afraid, as well as the main source of that emotion. For example, you might communicate fear caused by a monster you just saw around the corner, grief at the loss of a friend, or happiness derived from pride in your performance in combat. A dark elf has advantage on this check.</p>

                <p class="indent">As an action, you can cause the Pyroconverger to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                <p class="indent">Each time you use the Pyroconverger, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the Pyroconverger malfunctions: you take 4d6 fire damage, and you can't use the Pyroconverger again until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a wish spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.</p>
                <p class="indent">For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.</p>
                <p class="indent">The dagger has the following additional properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Siphon Vitality.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain 1d10 hit points per soul released.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Annihilation.</em></strong> If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Born from the minds of the gods, the creatures that populate the gods’ realm are called Nyxborn. Nyxborn creatures resemble mortal beings, but philosophers debate their true character. Are they idealized forms of mortal beings, free from the imperfections and transience that causes mortals to suffer and die? Or are they hollow and soulless shades, lacking the authenticity and pathos that make mortal existence worthwhile?</p>
                    <p class="indent">A Nyxborn is like a fragment of divinity, an idea or a dream that is incarnate. You embody an idea—like the way leaves turn toward the sun or the feeling of ocean sand between the toes, the way the heart stirs when the tide of battle changes or the sadness that lingers when remembering a happy moment of childhood.</p>
                    <p class="indent">These ideas, dreams, memories, and feelings are the stuff Nyx is made of, and a Nyxborn is shaped from that raw material. You might have been specifically crafted by one of the gods to serve a certain purpose. Or your existence could be an accident caused by a confluence of supernatural forces. The Nyxborn Origin table offers a handful of suggestions that might explain how you came to be, and the Nyxborn Quirks table describes some special effects that might linger around your person.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, you gain the following traits:</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cloak of Stars.</em></strong> As an action, you wrap yourself in a starry cloak, appearing like a silhouette formed of the night sky. When you do, attack rolls have disadvantage against you. This cloak lasts for 1 minute, until you doff it (no action required), or until you die. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Nyxborn Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>You possess a precious gift coveted not just by mortals but by the gods themselves: the gift of clear communication between the mortal and divine realms. As an oracle, you can perceive the whims of the gods and petition them for glimpses of their vast insight. This gift also comes with a curse, though, which typically takes the form of dire insights. Consult the Oracle Curse table to determine what unwanted revelations you receive.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The gods seek mortal oracles to act as their agents. As a result, most oracles devote themselves to the service of a single god and learn to ignore the voices of all others. Occasionally, two gods agree to share the services of an oracle. Oracles who try to remain independent often find themselves pursued by the agents of evil gods who would bind them to the god’s service, if necessary.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You gain the following traits:</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ears of the Oracle.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Celestial, the language of the gods. In addition, a god might deliver a message through you, and you can decide whether to use your own voice or to allow the god’s voice to come through your mouth to deliver the message, translated into any language you speak.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Oracle’s Insight.</em></strong> The gods give you flashes of insight that help you bring your efforts to fruition. When you make an ability check, you can roll a d10 and add the number rolled to the check. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to add the d10, but you must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Oracle’s Piety.</em></strong> Your oracular abilities improve as your piety score increases. Instead of gaining the piety benefits associated with any god (as described in chapter 2), you gain the following traits when you reach the specified piety score.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for any spell that you cast through these traits.</p>
                    <h4>AUGUR</h4>
                    <p><em>Piety 3+ Oracle trait</em></p>
                    <p>You can cast augury as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <h4>SEER</h4>
                    <p><em>Piety 10+ Oracle trait</em></p>
                    <p>You can cast divination as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <h4>SIBYL</h4>
                    <p><em>Piety 25+ Oracle trait</em></p>
                    <p>You can cast commune as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You also can’t be surprised, provided you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
                    <h4>DIVINE ORACLE</h4>
                    <p><em>Piety 50+ Oracle trait</em></p>
                    <p>You can increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 2, as well as increasing your maximum for the chosen score by 2.</p>

                    <p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.</p>
                    <p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Command the Deep.</em></strong> The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, you can cast the dominate monster spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aquatic Metamorphosis.</em></strong> You can cast the true polymorph spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Bident.</em></strong> To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Nylea wields the shortbow Ephixis, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bow of the Wild.</em></strong> This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon’s long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessing of the Wild.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>
                    <ul class="unstyled mb">
                        <li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> The bow has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>

                    </ul><br/>
                    <p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.</p>
                    <p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Arrows of the Seasons.</em></strong> The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it’s used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spring.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Summer.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Autumn.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the wall of thorns spell there.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Winter.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the ice storm spell there.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Bow.</em></strong> The bow can’t be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.</p>

                    <p>Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it’s typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spear of the Sun.</em></strong> This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Luminous.</em></strong> The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sun’s Retaliation.</em></strong> When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: guiding bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Spear.</em></strong> If taken to Erebos’s palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos’s service.</p>

In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Erebos grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it’s typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Heliod.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Whip of the Dead.</em></strong> Erebos’s whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld.

                    <p class="indent">Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Erebos’s Claim.</em></strong> While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either circle of death or dominate monster (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dusk.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Whip.</em></strong> To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month.</p>

                <p>Lost for ages in the Underdark, <em>Dawnbringer</em> appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. Whi1e grasping the hilt you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. <em>Dawnbringer</em> has all the properties of a <em>sun blade</em>.</p>
                <p class="indent">While holding the weapon. vou an use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> <em>Dawnbringer</em> is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you're attuned to it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Forged by ancient sun worshipers, <em>Dawnbringer</em> is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.</p>
                <p class="indent">Long years lost in darkness have made <em>Dawnbringer</em> frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.</p>

            <description>	
                <p>A spell gem can contain one spell from any class’s spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gems properties. While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your classs spell list. Doing so doesn’t require any components and doesn’t require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.</p>
                <p class="indent">Each spell gem has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as shown in the Spell Gem table.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can imbue the gem with a spell if you’re attuned to it and it’s empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell’s level must be no higher than the gems maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them, but they can be worth half as much as normal.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once imbued with a spell. the gem can’t be imbued again until the next dawn.</p>
                <p class="indent">Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature wilhin 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting ability) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.</p>
                <p class="indent">Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as docs the application of <em>oil of etherealness</em> or <em>universal solvent</em>. The glob also dissolves instantly itexposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.</p>
                <p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand's last charge. roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.</p>
                <p class="indent">A <em>wand of viscid globs</em> is destroyed if exposed to sun light for 1 hour without interruption.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This backpack contains the spirit of an air elemental and a compact leather balloon. While you're wearing the backpack, you can deploy the balloon as an action and gain the effect of the levitate spell for 10 minutes, targeting yourself and requiring no concentration. Alternatively, you can use a reaction to deploy the balloon when you're falling and gain the effect ofthe feather fall spell for yourself.</p>
                <p class="indent">When either spell ends, the balloon slowly deflates as the elemental spirit escapes and returns to the Elemental Plane of Air. As the balloon deflates, you descend gently toward the ground for up to 60 feet. If you are still in the air at the end of this distance, you fall if you have no other means of staying aloft.</p>
                <p class="indent">After the spirit departs, the backpack's property is unusable unless the backpack is recharged for 1 hour in an elemental air node, which binds another spirit to the backpack.</p>

        <element name="Devastation Orb" type="Magic Item" source="Princes of the Apocalypse" id="ID_WOTC_POTA_MAGIC_ITEM_DEVASTATION_ORB">
            <description>
                <p>A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p>
                <p class="indent">A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p>
                <p class="indent">A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols ofthe orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</p>
                <p class="indent">Regardless ofthe type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Air Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Earth Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects ofthe earthquake spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose ofthe spell's effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fire Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Water Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 ofthe Dungeon Master's Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood's path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.</p>

                <p>This small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you whisper the word "seek" and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don't need to see it now. If the target isn't within range or if there is no clear path to it. the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.</p>
                <p class="indent">When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage. The dart's magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart.</p>

                <p>A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A water weird (see the Monster Manual for statistics) is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the water weird to emerge. The water weird acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can command the water weird telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the water weird to retract into it or if the water weird is dead.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the water weird is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new water weird forms inside it.</p>
                <p class="indent">The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the water weird contained within it.</p>

Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn't fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet, you land (or fall), and you must expend another charge to use the suit again.</p>
                <p class="indent">The suit regains all of its expended charges after spending at least 1 hour in an elemental air node.</p>

            <description>
                <p>A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, <em>Orcsplitter</em> is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</li>
                    <li>When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</li>
                    <li>You can't be surprised by orcs while you're not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.</li>
                    <li>You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be frightened while you're not incapacitated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> <em>Orcsplitter</em> is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> <em>Orcsplitter</em> is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.</p>

While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I demand and deserve the largest share ofthe spoils, and I refuse to part with anything that's mine." In addition, if you are attuned to Drown for 24 consecutive hours, barnacles form on your skin. The barnacles can be removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.</p>

            <description>
                <p>An abracadabrus is an ornate, gemstone-studded wooden chest that weighs 25 pounds while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 1½ feet on a side.</p>
                <p class="indent">The chest has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch the closed lid of the chest and expend 1 of the chest's charges while naming one or more nonmagical objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of 1 gp or less. The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example, the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.</p>
                <p class="indent">The chest regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the chest loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This cauldron is made of thick copper that has turned green with age. It is 4 feet wide, has a mouth 3½ feet in diameter, weighs 50 pounds, and can hold up to 30 gallons of liquid. Embossed on its bulging sides are images of satyrs and nymphs in repose, holding ladles. The cauldron comes with a lid and has side handles. It sits on five little clawed feet that keep it from tipping.</p>
                <p class="indent">If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew, which can provide one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.</p>
                <p class="indent">The cauldron can create stew three times. It then ceases to function until the next dawn, when it regains all its uses.</p>

                <p>This tiny silver fishhook has a little gold feather attached to it.

At the end of each uninterrupted hour of immersion, roll a d6. On a 6, a floppy, 6-inch-long magical fish appears on the end of the hook. The color and properties of the conjured fish are determined by rolling on the Hook of Fisher's Delight table. Once the hook conjures a fish, it can't do so again until the next dawn.</p>

                <p class="indent">A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer.

                <p class="indent">A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian are within 10 feet of each other.</p>

                <p class="indent">The codicil was written by followers of Auril as a primer on her worship. The first page is a title page with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled among these descriptions is a spell that wizards can learn (frost fingers, and a poem called "Rime of the Frostmaiden" (see appendix E)). The poem is an incantation, the power of which can be used to split a glacier (see chapter 6). The poem might have other capabilities, at your discretion</p>

        <element name="Ythryn Mythallar" type="Magic Item" source="Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden" id="ID_WOTC_IDROTF_MAGIC_ITEM_YTHRYN_MYTHALLAR">
            <description>
                <p>A mythallar looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.</p>
                <p class="indent">All creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.</li>
                    <li>You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Touching the Mythallar.</em></strong> Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).</p>

                    <p>This charm has 5 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to create a magical snowball in your hand and throw it. You must have a hand free to hold the snowball, or the charge is wasted. The snowball is a magic ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, it deals 1d4 cold damage on a hit, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you score a critical hit with the snowball, the target is blinded until the end of its next turn. The snowball vanishes immediately after you hit or miss with it, or at the end of your turn if you don't throw it. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.</p>

        <element name="Draakhorn" type="Magic Item" source="Rise of Tiamat" id="ID_WOTC_ROT_MAGIC_ITEM_DRAAKHORN">		
            <description>
                <p>The Draakhorn was a gift from Tiamat in the war between dragons and giants. It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.</p>
                <p class="indent">The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.</p>
                <p class="indent">Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn’s history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.</p>

                <p>Individually, the five dragon masks resemble the dragons they are named for. When two or more of the dragon masks are assembled, however, they transform magically into the Mask of the Dragon Queen. Each mask shrinks to become the modeled head of a chromatic dragon, appearing to roar its devotion to Tiamat where all the masks brought together are arranged crown-like on the wearer’s head. Below the five masks, a new mask shapes itself, granting the wearer a draconic visage that covers the face, neck, and shoulders.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you are attuned to and wear this mask, you can have any of the properties from any one mask. Additionally, you gain the Damage Absorption from each of the five dragon masks, and you gain five uses of the Legendary Resistance property.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Crafted from a thick, red fabric, this banner measures 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The krig (war) rune is displayed on the fabric with round, metal plates sewn into it. It can be attached to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mark of Courage.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the frightened condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentinel Standard.</em></strong> You can see invisible creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Standard’s Shield.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gift of Battle.</em></strong> You can transfer the banner's magic to a place by tracing the krig rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 500-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the banner to be within 5 feet of you and during which you choose creatures, creature types, or both that will benefit from the magic. At the end, the banner is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:</p>
                <p>While in the 500-foot-radius sphere, the creatures you chose during the transfer process are immune to the frightened condition and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and AC.</p>

                <p>This diamond contains the blood of a creature-blood that appears in the form of the blod (blood) rune. While the item is on your person, you can use your action to divine the location of the creature nearest to you that is related to the blood in the item and that isn't undead. You sense the distance and direction of the creature relative to your location. The creature is either the one whose blood is in the item or a blood relative.</p>
                <p class="indent">This item is made from a large diamond worth at least 5,000 gp. When the blood of a creature is poured onto it during the creation process, the blood seeps into the heart of the gem. If the gem is destroyed, the blood evaporates and is gone forever. A vengeful being might use a blod stone to hunt down an entire bloodline. Such stones are sometimes given as gifts to siblings or handed down from parent to child.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wyrmslayer.</em></strong> As an action, you can point the claw at a dragon within 30 feet of you. The dragon must then succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to all damage types until the end of your next turn. This property can be used three times.

                <p class="indent">As an action, you can cast the <em>teleport</em> spell by blowing into the shell.

            <description>
                <p>This wooden gavel is small by giant reckoning but nearly the size of a warhammer in human hands. The venn (friend) rune is inscribed in mithral in the base of the haft. Among giants, this item is used as part of rituals to resolve disputes. The gavel has the following properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Arbiter's Shield.</em></strong> At the start of every combat, attack rolls against you have disadvantage before the start of your first turn, provided that the gavel is on your person.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bond of Amity.</em></strong> As an action, you can use the gavel to strike a point on a hard surface. The first time in the next minute that a creature within 60 feet of that point deals damage to another creature with an attack that hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt to the target. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gift of Truth.</em></strong> You can transfer the gavel's magic to a place by tracing the venn rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 30-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the gavel to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the gavel is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:</p>
                <p>Whenever a creature utters a lie while within the 30-foot-radius sphere, that creature takes 5 psychic damage and flinches visibly.</p>

Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human.</p>
                <p class="indent">The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

                <p>This appears to be a simple ingot of iron ore, about a foot long and a few inches across. Inspection of its surface reveals the faint, silvery outline of the skold (shield) rune. The ingot has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Runic Shield.</em></strong> You have a + 1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shield Bond.</em></strong> As a bonus action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, other than yourself. Until the end of your next turn, any damage the target takes is reduced to l, but you take half the damage prevented in this way. The damage you take can't be reduced in any way. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shield Ward.</em></strong> You can transfer the ingot's magic to a nonmagical item-a shield or a two-handed melee weapon-by tracing the skold rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the ingot is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:</p>
                <p><strong><em>Shield.</em></strong> The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. Its magic gives you a + 1 bonus to AC, and the first time after each of your long rests that damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. You must be wielding the shield to gain these benefits.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Weapon.</em></strong> The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It grants you a +l bonus to AC while you're holding it.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The Korolnor Scepter is one of ten Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, forged by the dwarven gods and given to the ruling houses of the ancient dwarven empire. The Korol­ nor Scepter's location was unknown for the longest time until a storm giant queen, Neri, found it in a barnacle- covered shipwreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. The Ruling Scepters are all roughly the same size and shape, but their materials and properties vary.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Korol nor Scepter is a tapered mithral rod as thick and long as a dwarf's forearm, with a small platinum knob at the bottom and a rounded disk adorned with a ring of seven tiny blue gems at the top.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this scepter, which can be wielded as a magic club.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use the properties of the Wyrmskull Throne, as well as the properties of the scepter itself. The scepter has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges at dawn. Its properties are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are underground or underwater, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to determine the distance to the surface.</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the sending spell from the scepter.</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the teleport spell from the scepter. If the destination is within 60 feet of the Wyrmskull Throne, there is no chance of a teleport error or mishap occurring.</li>

            <description>
                <p>A navigation orb is a hollow, 7-foot-diameter sphere of thin, polished mithral with a large skye (cloud) rune embossed on its outer surface. The orb levitates 10 feet above the ground and is keyed to a particular cloud castle, allowing you to control that castle's altitude and movement while the orb is inside the castle. If the orb is destroyed or removed from its castle, the castle's altitude and location remain fixed until the orb is returned or replaced.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can cause one of the following effects to occur if you are touching the orb:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The castle moves at a speed of 1 mph in a straight line, in a direction of your choice, until the castle stops or is made to stop, or until another action is used to change its direction. If this movement brings the castle into contact with the ground, the castle lands gently.</li>
                    <li>The castle, if it is moving, comes to a gradual stop.</li>
                    <li>The castle makes a slow, 90-degree turn clockwise or counterclockwise (turning a northerly view into a westerly view, for example). The castle can turn while it is moving in a straight line.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">Any creature touching the orb knows the altitude of the base of the castle above the ground or water below it.</p>

                <p>This triangular fire opal measures about three inches on each side and is half an inch thick. The ild (fire) rune shimmers within its core, causing it to be slightly warm to the touch. The opal has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ignite.</em></strong> As an action, you can ignite an object within 10 feet of you. The object must be flammable, and the fire starts in a circle no larger than 1 foot in diameter.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fire Tamer.</em></strong> As an action, you can extinguish any open flame within 10 feet of you. You choose how much fire to extinguish in that radius.</p>

The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the opal is destroyed, and the rune appears in red on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:</p>
                <p><b>Weapon.</b> The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.</p>
                <p><b>Armor.</b> The armor is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. You have resistance to cold damage while wearing the armor.</p>

                <p>This orb of granite is about the size of an adult human's fist. The stein (stone) rune appears on it in the form of crystalline veins that run across the surface. The orb has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Indomitable Stand.</em></strong> As an action, you can channel the orb's magic to hold your ground. For the next minute or until you move any distance, you have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist effects that force you to move.

            <description>
                <p>This blue pennant is crafted from silk and is five feet long and whips about as if buffeted by a wind. The vind (wind) rune appears on its surface, looking almost like a cloud. The pennant has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wind Step.</em></strong> As an action, you fly up to 20 feet. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.</p>

                <p><strong>Boots/Cloak.</strong> The pair of boots or cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing the item, you can convert up to 20 feet of your movement on each of your turns into flight. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft . You can also cast feather fall once from the item, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or smaller, otherwise the potion does nothing. For that duration, your Strength becomes 25, if it isn't already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled (your current hit points are doubled when you drink the potion). In addition, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of 1d8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of 1d10) when used with two hands.</p>
                <p class="indent">When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum become temporary hit points.</p>
                <p class="indent">This potion is a pale white liquid made from the tongue of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It tastes sweet, however, when consumed.</p>

The snake instantly falls from the robe, slithers into an unoccupied space next to you, and acts on your initiative count. The snake can tell friendly creatures from hostile ones and attacks the latter. The snake disappears in a harmless puff of smoke after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you dismiss it (no action required). Once detached, a snake can't return to the robe. When all of the robe's snakes have detached, the robe becomes a nonmagical garment.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Frigid Touch.</em></strong> As an action, you can touch a body of water and freeze the water in a 10-foot-radius sphere around the spot you touched. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gift of Frost.</em></strong> You can transfer the shard's magic to a nonmagical item-a cloak or a pair of boots-by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:</p>
                <p><strong>Cloak.</strong> The cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you have resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in snowy terrain.</p>
                <p><strong>Boots.</strong> The pair of boots is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you ignore difficult terrain while walking, and you can walk on water.</p>

        <element name="Wyrmskull Throne" type="Magic Item" source="Storm King’s Thunder" id="ID_WOTC_SKT_MAGIC_ITEM_WYRMSKULL_THRONE">
            <description>
                <p>Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire, the Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet-the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.</p>
                <p class="indent">After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.</p>
                <p class="indent">Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.</p>
                <p class="indent">Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic-the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Throne.</em></strong> The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.</li>
                    <li>Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.</li>
                    <li>As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.</li>
                    <li>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</li>
                    <li>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Throne.</em></strong> The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

Once the spell has been cast three times, the bracelet can no longer cast it. Thereafter, you can cast stone shape as an action.

Creatures of flesh that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against <em>flesh to stone</em> cast from the bracelet. If such a creature's save is successful, the bracelet breaks your attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are petrified instantly. (The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan)</p>

            <description>
                <p>This dark cloak is made of cured hell hound hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a hell hound for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the polymorph spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hell hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times.</p>
                <p class="indent">The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to 0 hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in hell hound form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a hell hound. Thereafter, only remove curse or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse the transformation. (Against the Giants)</p>

                <p>Waythe is a unique greatsword most recently in the possession of a high-ranking cloud giant ambassador.</p>

It is protective of its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned character to gain attunement with the sword.) Waythe is courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and vocally urges bold action. It is likely to come into conflict with an evil or a timid wielder. (Against the Giants)</p>

            <description>
                <p>Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep. Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon, but the weapon is searching for a new owner.</p>
                <p class="indent">Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell’s barrier of magical force.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hurling.</em></strong> The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Illumination.</em></strong> While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city’s defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.</p>
                <p class="indent">If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can’t be wielded. Nothing short of a wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.</p>

        <element name="Blackstaff" type="Magic Item" source="Waterdeep: Dragon Heist" id="ID_WOTC_WDH_MAGIC_ITEM_BLACKSTAFF">
            <description>
                <p>The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see "Personality" below).</p>
                <p class="indent">The Blackstaff has the magical properties of a staff of power (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide) in addition to the following properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Animate Walking Statues.</em></strong> You can expend 1 or more of the staff’s charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun’s spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see "Personality" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dispel Magic.</em></strong> You can expend 1 of the staff’s charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Drain Magic.</em></strong> This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff’s charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Master of Enchantment.</em></strong> When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff’s primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.</p>
                <p class="indent">In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff’s wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spirit Trap.</em></strong> When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can’t be raised from the dead.)</p>
                <p class="indent">Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben’s spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben’s spirit has the staff’s Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben’s spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.</p>

                <p>This armband appears to have thin daggers strapped to it.

A dagger vanishes if you don’t hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.</p>

                <p class="indent">The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the command spell. If you target a dragon with this casting, the dragon has disadvantage on its saving throw. The staff regains 1d10 charges daily at dawn.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This bright plume is made from the feather of a diatryma (pronounced dee-ah-TRY-mah), a Large, colorful, flightless bird native to the Underdark. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the feather into a Large unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you, the feather becomes a living diatryma for up to 6 hours, after which it reverts to its feather form. It reverts to feather form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching the bird.</p>
                <p class="indent">When the diatryma reverts to feather form, the magic of the feather can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
                <p class="indent">The diatryma uses the statistics of an axe beak, except that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>

                <p>After you write a message of fifty words or fewer on this magic sheet of parchment and speak a creature’s name, the parchment magically folds into a Tiny paper bird and flies to the recipient whose name you uttered. The recipient must be on the same plane of existence as you, otherwise the bird turns into ash as it takes flight.</p>
                <p class="indent">The bird is an object that has 1 hit point, an Armor Class of 13, a flying speed of 60 feet, a Dexterity of 16 (+3), and a score of 1 (−5) in all other abilities, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">It travels to within 5 feet of its intended recipient by the most direct route, whereupon it turns into a nonmagical and inanimate sheet of parchment that can be unfolded only by the intended recipient.

                <p class="indent">If smokepowder is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an aboleth named Golorr, transformed by magic into an object.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Stone of Golorr has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 minor beneficial property</li>
                    <li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Legend Lore.</em></strong> The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.</p>
                <p class="indent">By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can’t lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.</p>
                <p class="indent">The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember’s secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Failed Memory.</em></strong> When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A remove curse spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a greater restoration spell does so automatically.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Stone.</em></strong> While in stone form, the aboleth isn’t a creature and isn’t subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone’s remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone’s destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.</p>

                <p>Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, a creature attuned to the Black Crystal Tablet can use it to cast eyebite or gate (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This ornate chair is designed to propel and maneuver a ship through space.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Passive Properties.</em></strong> The following properties of the helm come into play even when no creature is attuned to it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an envelope of fresh air around the ship while it is in the void of space (but not underwater). This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel’s beam, so that creatures aboard and near the ship can breathe normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship’s decks as they normally would. Creatures and objects that fall overboard bob in a gravity plane that extends out from the main deck for a distance equal in length to the vessel’s beam.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Active Properties.</em></strong> The sensation of being attuned to the helm is akin to being immersed in warm water. While attuned to the helm, you gain the following abilities while you sit in it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use the helm to propel the vessel across or through water and other liquids at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot.</li>
                    <li>You can use the helm to propel the vessel through air or space at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot × 10.</li>
                    <li>Provided you have at least one unexpended spell slot, you can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the same way that oars or a rudder can maneuver a seafaring ship.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you like, you can see what’s happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Drawback.</em></strong> While attuned to the helm, you cannot expend your own spell slots.</p>

                <ul>

            <description>
                <p>Each professor orb takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.</p>
                <p class="indent">A Professor Orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the "Sentient Magic Items" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Regardless of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling 3d6 for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can’t initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.</p>
                <p class="indent">A Professor Orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition to the knowledge it possesses, a professor orb can cast the mage hand cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This shield is made from the scale of an ancient white dragon. It has a rune burned into its outward-facing side. A character who examines the rune and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check recognizes it as an uven ("enemy" in Giant) rune that confers great power.</p>
                <p class="indent">While holding the shield, you benefit from the following properties.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Winter’s Friend.</em></strong> You are immune to cold damage.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Deadly Rebuke.</em></strong> Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 3d6 necrotic damage to that creature.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane.</em></strong> You can cast the bane spell from the shield (save DC 17). The spell does not require concentration and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from the shield, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Gift of Vengeance.</em></strong> You can transfer the shield’s magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time of the magic weapon’s creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, or undead.</p>

            <description>
                <p>The longsword, Tearulai, is a sentient, neutral good sword of sharpness with an emerald-colored blade and precious gemstones embedded in its hilt and pommel. The sword’s magical properties are suppressed until it is removed from Valdemar’s skull.</p>
                <p class="indent">Evil creatures can’t attune to Tearulai; any evil creature that tries to do so takes 20 psychic damage. The weapon’s emerald blade can’t be damaged or dulled, and the sword can’t be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or transport via plants (4 charges).</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. In addition, the sword can ascertain the true value of any gemstone brought within 5 feet of it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielder’s goals run counter to its own, Tearulai attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain, whereupon it can use its transport via plants spell to return whence it came.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.</p>

            <description>
                <p>This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mildscented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would. The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.</p>
                <p class="indent">Wyllow’s staff is peculiar in that it can’t create roses, which the archdruid dislikes. If a rose is chosen, a daisy grows instead.</p>

Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler grenade must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by them.</p>

Thereafter, the ruby can’t be removed unless you detach it as an action or the weapon is destroyed. Not even an antimagic fieid causes it to fall off. The ruby does fall off the weapon if your attunement to the ruby ends.</p>

                        <p><b>Hydra’s Curse.</b> Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an Attack roll with this weapon one cord disappears from the handle. However, if there is only one cord left, roll a d100. On a 15 or less the last cord disappears, making the whip useless and unable to grow any cords ever again. If you roll higher than 15 the last cord remains attached.</p>

                        Rare Wand
                        Requires attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock or Wizard
                        Intellect of the Floating Eye. When attuned to this wand
                        you gain a +2 bonus to your Intelligence score. Furthermore
                        you gain a +1 bonus to all Perception checks you make.
                        Arcane Lens. The wand holds 3 charges, which it regains
                        every day at dawn. As an action you can target a creature you
                        can see within a 120ft. range and expend a charge to cast a
                        spell. Roll a d4 to determine what happens.
                        1. Fear Ray. The target has to make a Wisdom saving throw
                        (DC 16). On a failed save they are Frightened for 1 minute.
                        They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their
                        turns, ending the effect on a success.
                        2. Necrotic Ray. A creature within range has to make a
                        Constitution saving throw vs your spell save DC or take 3d6+2
                        Necrotic damage
                        3. Sleep Ray. The target must make a Wisdom saving
                        throw (DC 16). On a failed save they fall asleep and remain
                        unconscious for 1 minute. They awaken if they take damage
                        or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no
                        effect on constructs and undead.
                        4. Spell of the Master. You cast a damaging spell of your
                        choice of level 3 or lower from your list of spells. You do not
                        expend a spellslot for this.

                        Brought Back. When you are attuned to this sword and fail
                        at least one death save you are healed for an amount equal to
                        half of your maximum hit points. This effect can only
                        happen once ever to the attuned.

                        described above you owe your life to an infernal creature
                        or entity of the choice of your GM. How and when this will
                        become clear, the motivation and character of this being and
                        all other details will be determined by the GM.

                        Constitution saving throw (DC 16). They take 8d8 Necrotic
                        damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.
                        If the target is a Plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the
                        saving throw with disadvantage. The strike deals 64 damage
                        on a failed save and 32 on a succesful save. If you target a
                        nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub,
                        it doesn’t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.
                        This feature has no effect on Undead or Constructs. You can
                        use this feature once per long rest.

                        not follow the wishes of the pit fiend which posseses it. The
                        fiend may suggest putting their hand in flames, this deals 2d6

                        Deflection. If you are the target of a melee attack, you
                        can use your reaction to try and deflect the blow with this

                        to attack rolls you make with this weapon. Because it flies on

                        creature you heal 2 hit points instead.

However, his commentary is endless.</p>

                        <p><b>Fingers Crossed (Curse).</b> Once Arthanox is on your finger he will not let go. Trying to do so requires an Intelligence saving throw (DC 24). On a failed save you take 1d8 Psychic damage on a successful save you remove him.</p>

                        Very Rare Wondrous Item
                        Unleashed Terror. As an action you can unstopper the
                        flask. When you do so, roll a d4. One of the following things
                        happens. After the effect happened the flask can be stoppered
                        again, it can then be used again in 1d4 days.
                        1. Dark Concoction. The flask spews forth a thick black
                        slime in a 20ft. line. A creature hit by the slime has to make a
                        Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 Poison damage.
                        2. Fumes of Madness. A thin whisp of smoke flows out of
                        the flask. The creature which unstoppered the flask has to
                        make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save they
                        attack a random creature on their next turn.
                        3. Mind Blast. A wave of psychic energy blasts outward from
                        the flask in a 20ft. sphere.
                        All creatures in the area have to make a Wisdom saving throw
                        (DC 14). On a failed save they take 2d8 Psychic damage. On a
                        succesful save they take half damage.
                        4. Old One’s Blessing. The creature that opened the flask
                        regains an amount of hit points equal to 2d6+ their Wisdom
                        modifier.

                        Very Rare Wondrous Item (Cursed)
                        Requires attunement
                        Lifeblood. When filled with 10 fluid ounces (300ml) of
                        blood the contents gain the effects of a Greater healing potion,
                        healing 4d4+4 when consumed.
                        The contents are still considered blood and retain all
                        (harmful) effects that drinking it might have. It takes a
                        creature 1 minute to drink the contents of the cup. A creature
                        which is used to consuming blood (like a vampire) can drink
                        the contents of the cup in a single action.
                        When the cup is emptied by drinking the blood, it tarnishes
                        and darkens. Roll a d20, on a 1 the cup rusts and crumbles to
                        dust. If attempted to fill with blood again within 48 hours
                        after using, it will instantly be destroyed in the same way.
                        When these 48 hours have elapsed the cup clears of any
                        tarnish and darkness and can be used again.
                        Vampiric Tendencies (Curse). When a person has drunk
                        from the cup they have disadvantage on Perception and attack
                        rolls in direct sunlight for 1d12 days. This effect can be healed
                        by a Remove Curse spell.

                        Very Rare Wondrous Item
                        Terracotta Soldier. As an action you can take out the clay
                        from the pot and speak a command word. The clay grows
                        and shapes into a living terracotta soldier with a shield and
                        longsword. When the soldier takes the Attack action they can
                        make a multi-attack to make two melee weapon attacks with
                        their longsword.
                        The soldier has your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution
                        score. Their Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom are 6. They
                        have 40 hit points and an AC of 16.
                        The soldier listens to your commands but can not speak. In
                        combat the soldier rolls their own initiative. The soldier is
                        considered a Construct and lasts for 1 hour or until they are
                        destroyed.
                        Greater Enchantment. After using the clay you can refill the
                        pot with 5 parts sand and 1 part water and close it. After 3d6
                        days the ingredients have turned into clay which can be used
                        again.

                        created must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) Or
                        take 1d6 Fire damage. A creature must also make the saving

                        time on a turn or ends its turn there.

                        Rare Wondrous Item
                        Weapon of Clay. As an action you can take out the clay from
                        the pot and speak a command word. The clay grows and
                        shapes into any melee weapon of your choice. Attack and
                        damage rolls you make with this weapon receive a +1 bonus.
                        The weapon lasts for 1d4 hours, after which it crumbles.
                        Brittle. When you critically fail with the weapon, roll a d20.
                        On a 10 or lower the weapon breaks.
                        Lesser Enchantment. After using the clay you can refill the
                        pot with 5 parts sand and 1 part water and close it. After 2d6
                        hours the ingredients have turned into clay which can be used
                        again.

                        String of Storms. It takes 30 seconds to replace the
                        bowstring on a regular longbow or shortbow with this
                        enchanted bowstring.
                        Lightning Shots. This bowstring has 2 charges which
                        recharge at dawn. Whenever you take the attack action with
                        the bow this string is on, you can expend a charge to shoot an
                        arrow that crackles with lightning.
                        You make a ranged attack roll, on a hit the target takes
                        an extra 1d8 Lightning damage. The target has to make a
                        Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save they
                        become Paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw
                        at the end of its turn. If you miss your attack the charge is also
                        expended.

                        Rare Wondrous Item
                        Snowball Fighter. When you are wearing the mittens you
                        have resistance to Cold damage. You can use a bonus action
                        to hold your hands slightly apart and speak a command word.
                        A snowball (approximately 4 inch in diameter) coalesces
                        between your hands. You can make a ranged attack roll
                        (30/60ft.) to throw the snowball. A snowball deals no damage
                        but can extinguish torches and small flames.
                        When making a snowball you can speak a different
                        command word to create a ball of solid ice. You can make a
                        ranged attack roll (30/60ft.) to throw the ice ball. It deals 1d6
                        cold damage on a successful hit.
                        Winter’s Barrage. As an action you can hold up your hands
                        and speak a command word. A flurry of snowballs fly from
                        your open palms and bombard a 15ft. radius within 100ft. of
                        you. All creatures in the area have to make a Dexterity saving
                        throw (DC 14). On a failed save they take 2d6+2 Cold damage,
                        on a successful save they take half damage. You can use this
                        feature once per long rest.

                        reaction to gain immunity to Fire damage. This immunity
                        lasts until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature

                        Very Rare Wondrous Item
                        Barrage. As an action you can swing this quiver over your
                        shoulder, aim the opening, and yell a command word. All
                        remaining arrows in the quiver are consumed and a barrage
                        of magical arrows fires out of the quiver. All creatures in a
                        45ft. cone have to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14).
                        On a failed save a creature takes 1d4 Piercing damage for
                        each arrow that was left in the quiver. On a successful save a
                        creature takes half damage. Any arrows with special abilities
                        or features fire as a normal arrow. The quiver can hold a
                        maximum of 20 arrows and can in no way be enchanted to
                        hold more arrows without breaking the barrage enchantment.
                        You can use this feature once per day.

                        of existence or location. The tentacles last for 1 minute and
                        release if you move further than 15 ft. away from the target.
                        You can also release them as a free action. You can use this
                        feature 3 times per day.

                        Uncommon Wondrous Item
                        Lost and Found. This pair of socks is enchanted with
                        Divination magic. When you are wearing one of these socks
                        you always know exactly where the other is if it is within 10
                        miles of you. The enchantment can be blocked by Antimagic
                        fields. When the socks are more than 10 miles apart or are on
                        different planes, one automatically teleports to within 5ft. of
                        the other. Flip a coin to determine which sock teleports.
                        Sock-mail. When a sock teleports it also teleports objects
                        that are inside of it. Creatures or parts of creatures do not get
                        teleported but instead remain in their original place as the
                        sock disappears.

                        Uncommon Wondrous Item
                        Alarm. These spikes can easily be placed in soft ground
                        without any tools. Placing a spike in rock or wood requires a
                        tool like a hammer or bludgeoning weapon. When you place a
                        spike you may choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
                        A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are
                        within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you
                        are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand
                        bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
                        Single Spike. As an action you can place a single spike and
                        speak a command word to activate it. If any creature comes
                        within 10ft. of the spike the alarm is triggered.
                        Boundary of Spikes. You can place multiple spikes in a
                        200ft. radius, meaning each spike has to be within a 200ft.
                        range of all the other spikes. You can speak a command
                        word to link them together. Whenever a creature crosses the
                        perimeter line between two spikes the alarm is triggered.

                        Legendary Wondrous Item
                        Earthen Duplicate. As an action you can take out the clay
                        from the pot and speak a command word. The clay grows and
                        shapes into a clay duplicate of yourself.
                        The duplicate has 80 hit points and an AC of 14. It has
                        exactly the same ability scores, skills, and features as you. It
                        can cast the same spells as you but doing so expends your
                        own spell slots. Any bonuses you gain from magic items or
                        blessings do not carry over to the duplicate.
                        The duplicate is a Construct and clearly made of clay. It
                        listens to your commands but can not speak. In combat the
                        duplicate rolls their own initiative. The duplicate lasts for 1
                        hour or until it is destroyed.
                        Superior Enchantment. After using the clay you can refill
                        the pot with 5 parts sand and 1 part water and close it. After
                        3d6 weeks the ingredients have turned into clay which can be
                        used again.

                        Damage. 1d8+1 Piercing
                        Gemfused Steel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you
                        make with this weapon.
                        Pulse of Greed. When you make a succesful attack you may
                        roll a seperate damage die for an additional 1d8 Force damage.
                        If this roll is equal or higher than your first roll, you may add
                        it to the total damage. You may do this up to 5 times, so long
                        as the new roll is higher than the previous roll. If a new roll
                        deals less damage than the previous roll, the attack misses
                        completely and you receive half of the damage you would
                        have dealt to the target.

                        Steel of the Sea. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you
                        make with this weapon.
                        Might of the Blue. The range of this trident is doubled when
                        thrown over a body of water that is at least 20ft. wide. The
                        range is also doubled when you and your target are both
                        completely under water.
                        Ebb and Flow. When you make a successful range attack roll
                        with this weapon you can call it back to a free hand as part of
                        your attack action.
                        Lightning Conductor. A creature that is critically hit by
                        the trident becomes vulnerable to Lightning damage until
                        the end of its next turn. If a creature is immune it becomes
                        resistant, if it is resistant it loses the resistance.

                        Requires attunement
                        Graceful Descent. If you fall while attuned to this cloak, you
                        may speak a command word. Your rate of descent slows to
                        60ft. per round. When you land you take no falling damage
                        and you can land on your feet.
                        Flight of the Macaw. While attuned to this cloak, you may
                        spend an action to turn it into brightly colored wings. You
                        gain a flying speed of 60ft. The wings last for 2 hours. You can
                        use this feature again after a long rest.

                        mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. When
                        mimicking voices, you need to have heard the exact phrases
                        and words spoken by the voice you want to mimic. A creature
                        that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations
                        with a successful Insight check opposed by your Deception
                        check.

                        Land Lover. This compass has a small compartment under

                        needle always points towards the magnetic north. However,
                        the large needle always points towards the location the earth,
                        sand, dirt or pebbles in the compartment was taken from.
                        If the compartment is empty, filled with any other type of

                        Coin Ammunition. Instead of bullets this pistol uses gold
                        coins for ammunition. A coin can be loaded into the gun
                        through a slot on the top. The pistol magically turns the coin
                        into a bullet when the trigger is pulled.
                        You can also load a platinum coin into the gun instead of a
                        gold coin. When you do, you receive a +5 bonus to your attack
                        roll and deal an extra 1d10 damage on a hit. You can shoot
                        two platinum coins per long rest. The pistol malfunctions
                        whenever you try to shoot a third platinum coin or any type of
                        currency other than a gold coin.

                        Uncommon Wondrous Item
                        Bottled Glyph. As an action you can pour out the contents
                        of this bottle or throw it at a point up to 60ft. away causing
                        it to shatter on impact. The liquid creates a magical glyph in
                        this location at the end of your turn. The glyph remains for 24
                        hours, until activated or otherwise removed.
                        Blaze of Fire. If a creature is within 5ft. of the glyph, or when
                        it enters that space for the first time, they have to make a
                        Dexterity saving throw (DC 13). On a failed save they take
                        2d6+2 Fire damage and are Blinded until the end of their next
                        turn. On a successful save they take half damage and are not
                        Blinded. When the glyph is activated all other creatures within
                        30ft. of the glyph also have to make a Dexterity saving throw
                        (DC 8). On a failed save they are also Blinded until the end of
                        their next turn.

                        4d6 Force damage and become magically Restrained. On a
                        successful save they take half damage and are not Restrained.
                        A Restrained creature can attempt to make a Strength saving
                        throw (DC 14) at the end of its turn, freeing itself on a success.
                        Alternatively the restraints can be dispelled with Dispel Magic.

                        Touch of Gold. As an action you can touch a large or smaller

                        to turn to gold and is restrained. It must repeat the saving
                        throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.
                        On a failure, the creature turns to solid gold and is Petrified.

                        the next long rest they take. On a failed save they are Petrified
                        and turn to solid gold over the course of the long rest.
                        The DC of this curse’s Constitution saving throw increases
                        by 1 for each creature the gauntlet has ever petrified. When
                        the saving throw reaches 25 the gauntlet is destroyed.

                        creature is aware that magic is being used on them and you
                        can not see through their eyes. You can use this feature twice
                        per long rest.

                        it to shatter on impact. The liquid creates a magical glyph in
                        this location at the end of your turn. The glyph remains for 24
                        hours, until activated or otherwise removed.
                        Arcane Infused Poison. When a creature is in the 5ft cube the

                        All creatures that are within 20ft. of the glyph when it is
                        activated, have to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15).
                        On a failed save they take 3d8 Poison damage and become
                        Poisoned for 1 minute. A creature poisoned in this way also has
                        disadvantage on Concentration checks. On a successful save
                        they take half damage and are not Poisoned.

                        Very Rare Wand
                        Requires attunement by a Spellcaster
                        Nebula Charged. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls
                        and you ignore half cover when making a spell attack with
                        this wand.
                        Storm’s Reach. You can cast the cantrip Shocking Grasp
                        from this wand. When you cast this cantrip from the wand, it
                        has a 60ft. range. You make a ranged spell attack instead of a
                        melee spell attack.
                        Stormborn. While holding this wand you may change the
                        damage type of any damaging spell you cast to Lightning
                        or Thunder. You may change a spell in this way a number of
                        times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of
                        1) and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. Additionally
                        you are not impaired by extreme (non-magical) weather
                        conditions such as storms, blizzards and tornadoes.

                        Uncommon Wondrous Item
                        Bound Vessel. This map table only works when bound to
                        a ship. This can be done by placing a small wooden boat
                        figurine carved from the ship’s timber in the center of the
                        map. The map table has to be on the ship to function. If these
                        prerequisites are not met the map is completely blank.
                        Proximity Mapping. The map shows the surroundings in
                        a 30 mile radius around the ship. It depicts the landscape,
                        settlements and seafaring vessels. You can speak a command
                        word while you point to a location or vessel to name it. The
                        name appears as neat writing on the map.
                        The disc around the map indicates the north. The rings
                        above it show the position of the sun (or moon) as well as the
                        direction and force of the wind.

                        Shrouded in Shadow. When you are attuned to this cloak
                        you gain a +3 bonus on Stealth checks and a +2 bonus on
                        Deception checks.
                        Mimic’s Trickery (Curse). When this cloak is not being
                        worn it appears as a simple dark purple cloak. When a
                        creature puts on the cloak for the first time ever, they have
                        to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 13) or become
                        grappled by the cloak. A creature grappled by the cloak takes
                        1d4 Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature
                        can repeat the check at the end of each of its turns to escape
                        the grapple. Ability checks made to escape this grapple have
                        disadvantage. When the creature has escaped the grapple the
                        cloak can be worn without further problems. The cloak has an
                        AC of 11 and 5 hit points.

                        Suit of the Immortal Judge
                        Legendary Light Armor
                        Requires attunement
                        AC. 12 + Dexterity modifier
                        Undying. While attuned to this armor, you have advantage
                        on the first three death saving throws after every long rest.
                        Inspired Resolve. Whenever you have inspiration, you may
                        roll the inspiration die as a reaction and add that number to
                        your AC. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn. You
                        may use this feature twice per long rest.
                        Ruby Resonance. Whenever you kill a creature on your turn,
                        you may choose to regain a number of hit points up to the
                        number of hit points the creature had at the beginning of your
                        turn. You can only heal in this way from a single creature per
                        turn and can use this feature three times per long rest.

                        Blood Weapon
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A simple or martial melee weapon When you score a critical hit with an attack using this weapon, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt to a maximum of the hit points lost by the target. No effect against constructs or undead.
                        
                        Bound Armor
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        As a bonus action while you aren't wearing armor, you can cause this armor to appear in a flash of light around you—instantly donning it. Also as a bonus action while you are wearing this armor, you can cause the armor to vanish entirely, instantly doffing it.
                        
                        Bound Weapon
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        As a bonus action, you can cause this weapon to disappear
                        or appear instantly in a free hand.
                        
                        Cat
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        While wielding this weapon, as a bonus action you can
                        activate this rune by speaking its command phrase. For
                        1 hour, you can see normally in darkness to a distance of
                        120 feet. Once used, this property can’t be used again until
                        the following dawn.
                        
                        Chalice
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: Any armor or weapon
                        This runestone stores spells cast into it, holding them until
                        the attuned wearer uses them. The rune can store up to
                        5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains
                        1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.
                        Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level
                        into the rune by touching the rune as the spell is cast. The
                        spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the rune. If
                        the rune can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without
                        effect. The level of the spell used to cast the spell determines
                        how much space it uses.
                        While wearing this armor, you can cast any spell stored
                        in the rune. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC,
                        spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original
                        caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The
                        spell cast from the rune is no longer stored in it, freeing
                        up space.
                        Chaos
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        A popular project among apprentice artificers, this rune
                        embodies the chaos of unbound magic. When you score
                        a critical hit with an attack using this weapon, roll on the
                        Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook to create
                        a magical effect. If the effect is a spell that requires concentration,
                        it doesn't require concentration in this case and
                        lasts for its full duration.
                        Daywalker
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A suit of armor with a helmet or hood
                        While wearing this armor with the hood drawn, you are
                        unaffected by the sunlight sensitivity trait if you have it.
                        Death
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        Whenever you kill a Small or Medium humanoid with
                        an attack using this weapon, it rises immediately as a
                        zombie under your control with 1 hit point, as per the
                        animate dead spell. The creature uses the zombie statistics.
                        It remains animate for 1 minute, after which time it
                        collapses and dies.
                        Displacement
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A suit of light or medium armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, whenever you take
                        damage from an attack, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an
                        unoccupied space that you can see.
                        Dragon Slayer
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A martial weapon
                        When you hit a dragon with this weapon, it takes an extra
                        2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a
                        Strength saving throw or its flying speed (if any) is reduced
                        to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. If the target is
                        airborne, it descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches
                        the ground or the effect ends. For the purpose of this
                        weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon
                        type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.
                        Earthshaker
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A simple or martial melee weapon with the
                        heavy property
                        While you are wielding this weapon, you can use an action
                        to strike a point on the ground within reach, creating a
                        seismic disturbance as per the earthquake spell with a
                        duration of 1 round. Once used, this property can’t be used
                        again until the following dawn.
                        Elemental Shield
                        Runsestone, uncommon
                        Item: A suit of armor or a shield
                        When you first affix this rune to a suit of armor or a shield,
                        choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire,
                        lightning, or thunder. While wearing (armor) or wielding
                        (shield) this item, whenever you take damage of the chosen
                        type you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an
                        amount equal to twice your character level + your Constitution
                        modifier and suffer one level of exhaustion. You can
                        change the chosen damage type over the course of a short
                        or long rest by spending at least 30 minutes in contact
                        with the runestone.
                        Featherfoot
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: Any armor or weapon

                        shield) this item, you have a standing jump distance equal
                        to your current walking speed. Each foot you clear while
                        jumping costs a foot of movement, and you can't jump
                        further than your remaining movement in a turn.

                        Runestone, legendary
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, you can't be affected by
                        enchantment magic unless you choose to be.
                        Giant Slayer
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A martial weapon
                        When you hit a giant with this weapon, it takes an extra
                        2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a
                        Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this
                        weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type,
                        including ettins and trolls.
                        Hunt
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A simple of martial weapon with the ammunition
                        property
                        While you are wielding this weapon, you can use an action
                        on your turn to mark a creature you can see within 90 feet
                        of you. For 1 hour, when you hit the marked creature with
                        a ranged attack using this weapon you can use a bonus
                        action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of
                        it that you can see. Once used, this property can’t be used
                        again until the following dawn.
                        Journey
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, your speed increases
                        by 10 feet. In addition, you can travel at a fast pace
                        without suffering the normal penalty to passive Wisdom
                        (Peception) checks, and your food and water requirements
                        are halved.
                        Knock
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A gauntleted suit of armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, you can rap your fist
                        on an object to cast the knock spell on it. Once used, this
                        property can’t be used again until the following dawn.
                        Magebane
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        This runestone has three charges. When you hit a creature
                        with this weapon, you can expend a charge to cause any
                        spell effects of 3rd level or lower on the target to end. Additionally,
                        for each spell of 4th level or higher on the target,
                        make an ability check using your weapon ability. The DC
                        equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the
                        spell ends. The runestone regains 1d3 expended charges
                        daily at dawn.
                        Mariner
                        Runestone, common
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        This weapon or ammunition fired with it magically repels
                        water. Attack rolls you make using it aren't made with
                        disadvantage for being underwater.
                        Mark/ Recall
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, you can use an action to
                        magically mark a surface on which you are standing.
                        While a location is marked in this way, you can spend 1
                        minute concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell).
                        At the end of the period, you and up to five willing creatures
                        within 5 feet of you teleport to the marked location,
                        and the mark vanishes. Once you mark a location, you
                        can't do so again until the following dawn. If you mark
                        another location while you already have a mark, the older
                        mark vanishes.
                        Mime
                        Runestone, legendary
                        Item: Any armor or weapon
                        This runestone is able to mimic the properties of magic
                        items. A creature can spend a short rest spent focusing
                        on a magic item and this runestone. The magic item must
                        be of the same type as the type of equipment to which
                        this rune is affixed. Focus usually takes the form of quiet
                        meditation or other appropriate activity. If the short rest
                        is interrupted, the copying process fails. Otherwise, at
                        the end of the short rest the runestone gains the properties
                        of the magic item, excluding any fixed bonuses such
                        as those to attack and damage rolls, spell save DC, and
                        Armor Class. If a property has charges, it is copied with no
                        remaining charges.
                        Only the properties of one magic item can be copied at
                        a time. The mimicking process overwrites any existing
                        copied properties. The process automatically fails when
                        attempting to copy the properties of artifacts.
                        Nondetection
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: Any armor or weapon
                        While you are wearing (armor) or wielding (weapon or
                        shield) this item, you are hidden from divination magic.
                        You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through
                        magical scrying sensors.
                        Overshield
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A suit of heavy armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, you gain 8 temporary hit
                        points at the start of each of your turns.
                        Phoenix
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        When you're reduced to 0 hit points and start dying while
                        wearing this armor, this rune immediately casts fireball
                        centered on you. At the start of your next turn, instead of
                        rolling a death saving throw, you regain 1d6 hit points.
                        Once used, this property can’t be used again until the
                        following dawn.
                        Retribution
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A suit of armor or a shield
                        While you are wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) this
                        item, whenever you take damage from a creature you have
                        advantage on your next attack roll against creatures of that
                        type before the end of your next turn.
                        Serpent
                        Runestone, uncommon
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt
                        to poison it. The target must succeed on a Constitution
                        saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The
                        creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
                        of its turns. On a success, the effect ends. Once used, this
                        property can’t be used again until the following dawn.
                        Soultrap
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        When you kill a creature with a challenge rating equal to
                        or higher than your level with this weapon, you regain one
                        expended spell slot. This spell can't be of a level higher
                        than your proficiency bonus. Once used, this property can’t
                        be used again until the following dawn.
                        Superconductor
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        This runestone captures and stores magical potential for
                        short-term use, and can hold a number of spell levels equal
                        to the proficiency bonus of the creature attuned to it. When
                        you are targeted by a spell while holding this weapon, the
                        runestone gains a number of charges equal to the level
                        of the spell, up to the maximum the runestone can hold.
                        When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon,
                        you can expend a number of charges to deal an extra 1d6
                        force damage per charge expended.
                        This item loses any accrued charges when you finish a
                        short or long rest.
                        Tempest
                        Runestone, legendary
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with
                        this weapon it takes an extra 1d10 lightning damage. An
                        arc of lightning then leaps from that target to as many as
                        three additional creatures of your choice within 30 feet of
                        it, which also take 1d10 lightning damage.
                        Thief
                        Runestone, common
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        A favorite of cutpurses and thieves. Once per day while
                        wearing this armor you can reroll a failed Dexterity check.
                        If you do so, you must use the new roll.
                        Volant
                        Runestone, legendary
                        Item: A suit of armor
                        While you are wearing this armor, you gain a flight (hover)
                        speed equal to twice your walking speed.
                        Warmage
                        Runestone, rare
                        Item: A suit of armor or a shield
                        This runestone has three charges. While you are wearing
                        (armor) or wielding (shield) this item and fail a concentration
                        saving throw that you make to maintain concentration
                        on a spell due to taking damage, you can expend a charge
                        as a reaction to reroll the saving throw. If you do so, you
                        must use the new roll.
                        You can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to
                        recover an expended charge.
                        Warrior
                        Runestone, common
                        Item: A simple or martial weapon
                        Popular among mercenaries and soldiers, this runestone
                        ensures you keep your sword in your hand. While you
                        are wielding this weapon, you can’t be disarmed of this
                        weapon while you are conscious.
                        Wolfsbane
                        Runestone, very rare
                        Item: A simple or martial melee weapon
                        In darkness, the unsheathed blade or head of this weapon
                        sheds moonlight, creating bright light in a 15-foot radius
                        and dim light for an additional 15 feet. In addition, when
                        you hit a shapechanger with this weapon, it takes an extra
                        2d6 damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving
                        throw. On a failure, it immediately assumes its true form if
                        it was shapechanged and it can't shapechange until the
                        end of its next turn.

Despite its humble origins, the scythe is recognized as a symbol of death in many cultures because of its use in reaping. Rather than being too heavy for most smaller creatures, the scythe is too long for Small sized creatures to wield effectively.</p>
