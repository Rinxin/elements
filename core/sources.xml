Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied.</p><p>When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.</p><p>The cause is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, which is located somewhere in Chult, a mysterious peninsula far to the south, ringed with mountains and choked with rainforests.</p>]]>

			<p>Legends walk the lands of Theros, a realm shaped by deities and the deeds of heroes. From the temples of omen-speaking oracles to the five realms of the Underworld, the champions of the gods vie for immortal favor and a place among the world’s living myths.</p>
			<p>Choose a supernatural gift that sets you on the path of destiny, align yourself with one of Theros’s fifteen gods, then carve a tale of odysseys and ordeals across the domains of mortals, gods, and the dead.</p>
			<p>What legends will you challenge—mighty heroes, inevitable prophecies, or titans imprisoned by the gods? Where will destiny and immortal schemes lead you? And what tales will you leave behind, celebrated in the pantheon of myths and writ among the eternal stars?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Receive a supernatural gift from the gods, a set of special traits that mark your character for greatness.</li>
				<li>Select one of the new races for your character—such mythic peoples as the leonin or a satyr.</li>
				<li>New subclasses include the Bard’s College of Eloquence, masters of oratory; and the Paladin’s Oath of Glory, an affirmation of destiny laid out for you by divine providence.</li>
				<li>Encounter mythic monsters, creatures whose power and renown are such that their names are truly living myths. More than simply legendary, these creatures have abilities that will create a challenge fit for the gods.</li>
				<li>Wield god-weapons, signature items of the gods that allow your character to stand apart from other heroes. These can be a gift from your deity or perhaps you boldly stole it from them in a bid for ultimate power.</li>

					<p><strong>Magic Measured in Moments—and Eternities!</strong></p>
					<p>The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who seek to alter time have the potential to perform incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the great danger of intervening with time, which resists mortal interference. Deep Magic 16: Time Magicbrings the secrets of temporal magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A divine option for the Time Domain and a Timekeeper arcane tradition for wizards</li>
						<li>A Lost Traveller Background for those who wander in time</li>
						<li>12 new spells, including accelerate, chronal lance, time loop, and wall of time</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Mastery of time itself brings immense power to the caster, but runs enormous risks--not least attracting the attention of archmages and the gods themselves for your meddling! Seize this power boldly, and with respect for the dangers it contains!</p>
