Volo’s Guide to Monsters provides something exciting for players and Dungeon Masters everywhere!</p><p>The esteemed loremaster Volothamp Geddarm is back and he’s written a fantastical dissertation, covering some of the most iconic monsters in the Forgotten Realms.

Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied.</p><p>When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.</p><p>The cause is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger, which is located somewhere in Chult, a mysterious peninsula far to the south, ringed with mountains and choked with rainforests.</p>]]>

				<p>Legends walk the lands of Theros, a realm shaped by deities and the deeds of heroes. From the temples of omen-speaking oracles to the five realms of the Underworld, the champions of the gods vie for immortal favor and a place among the world’s living myths.</p>
				<p>Choose a supernatural gift that sets you on the path of destiny, align yourself with one of Theros’s fifteen gods, then carve a tale of odysseys and ordeals across the domains of mortals, gods, and the dead.</p>
				<p>What legends will you challenge—mighty heroes, inevitable prophecies, or titans imprisoned by the gods? Where will destiny and immortal schemes lead you? And what tales will you leave behind, celebrated in the pantheon of myths and writ among the eternal stars?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Receive a supernatural gift from the gods, a set of special traits that mark your character for greatness.</li>
					<li>Select one of the new races for your character—such mythic peoples as the leonin or a satyr.</li>
					<li>New subclasses include the Bard’s College of Eloquence, masters of oratory; and the Paladin’s Oath of Glory, an affirmation of destiny laid out for you by divine providence.</li>
					<li>Encounter mythic monsters, creatures whose power and renown are such that their names are truly living myths. More than simply legendary, these creatures have abilities that will create a challenge fit for the gods.</li>
					<li>Wield god-weapons, signature items of the gods that allow your character to stand apart from other heroes. These can be a gift from your deity or perhaps you boldly stole it from them in a bid for ultimate power.</li>

				<p>In Icewind Dale, adventure is a dish best served cold.</p>
				<p>Beneath the unyielding night sky, you stand before a towering glacier and recite an ancient rhyme, causing a crack to form in the great wall of ice. Beyond this yawning fissure, the Caves of Hunger await. And past this icy dungeon is a secret so old and terrifying that few dare speak of it. The mad wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood long to possess that which the god of winter’s wrath has so coldly preserved—as do you! What fantastic secrets and treasures are entombed in the sunless heart of the glacier, and what will their discovery mean for the denizens of Icewind Dale? Can you save Ten-Towns from the Frostmaiden’s everlasting night?</p>
				<p>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden is a tale of dark terror that revisits the forlorn, flickering candlelights of civilization known as Ten-Towns and sheds light on the many bone-chilling locations that surround these frontier settlements.</p>

					<p><strong>Magic Measured in Moments—and Eternities!</strong></p>
					<p>The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who seek to alter time have the potential to perform incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the great danger of intervening with time, which resists mortal interference. Deep Magic 16: Time Magicbrings the secrets of temporal magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A divine option for the Time Domain and a Timekeeper arcane tradition for wizards</li>
						<li>A Lost Traveller Background for those who wander in time</li>
						<li>12 new spells, including accelerate, chronal lance, time loop, and wall of time</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Mastery of time itself brings immense power to the caster, but runs enormous risks--not least attracting the attention of archmages and the gods themselves for your meddling! Seize this power boldly, and with respect for the dangers it contains!</p>

				<p><strong>Adventure In a Dark World of Deep Magic!</strong></p>
				<p>It is an age of war. Civilization slowly gives way to encroaching wilderness, and once-mighty empires now lie beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth of hope keeps lights aglow when dread things prowl, and priestly wardings are bent by demonic rage.</p>
				<p>The omens are dire. The roads to the shadow realm are open again, and the fey have returned to claim their ancient tribute. In the north the giants prepare for Ragnarok, while the goblins in the west grow restless. In the Crossroads, the shadow of the vampire princes falls across the land. The World Serpent is stirring—and not even all-knowing Baba Yaga can say what will happen next.</p>
				<p>Now more than ever, Midgard needs heroes to stand against the dark, driving it back with spell, steel, and cunning!</p>
				<p>The 460-page Midgard Worldbook includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Detailed description of Midgard’s empires, cities, and kingdoms, with associated heraldry, rulers, and adventure hooks for each state, large or small</li>
					<li>Characters from Baba Yaga to the lords of the Dragon Empire, from the honest folk of Zobeck to various elven holdouts of Dornig and the vampire lords of Morgau</li>
					<li>Full lore on the pantheons of the Northlands, Crossroads, Elves, and others, including divine domain lists, rituals, divine demands, and the various masks and sacred texts—plus rituals and ambitions of the Dark Gods, for the GM’s eyes alone!</li>
					<li>Revised and expanded lore of the planes, history, calendars, and conflicts of the world</li>
					<li>Forbidden lore of blood magic, void magic, and various dooms and items not meant for players’ eyes!</li>
					<li>And much more!</li>

				<![CDATA[<p>The Compendium of Forgotten Secrets: Awakening is a supplemental content expansion for the 5th Edition tabletop roleplaying game. Unleash power unlike any other, and change the fate of the world!</p>
				<p>Within these pages are seventeen eldritch forces, known as Alrisen, that will tempt players with power and curse them with dark magic. Each offers two unique character subclasses, and some offer a unique player-character race option. It also contains over 80 new spells, 100 warlock invocations, 17 familiars, and dozens of magical items. Carefully designed and balanced by a community of expert content creators, the mechanics presented within will feel right at home at your table.</p>
				<p>This content was created with one goal: Inspire fun and exciting roleplaying opportunities while providing crunchy, effective rules that will highlight the experiences players are looking for! Lovingly illustrated by a team of incredible artists, journey into a world created by your own imagination and see how the dice determine your fate.</p>
				<p>Whether you decide to build and preserve with the Eternal Citadel, bring ruin with the Accursed Archive, maintain the balance in service to the Warrior-Saint, let it all burn at the Ashen Wolf's side, forget your past through the Weaver of Lies, or make a pact with one of the twelve other Alrisen, you'll find party members to join you on your wild adventures!</p>
				<p>Each Alrisen acts as an Otherworldly Patron, granting power to warlocks who join their service. Other classes also gain a total of seventeen new options, such as the monk's Path of the Noble Serpent or the bard's College of Harbingers. These add new player options for everyone at the table, and offer new opportunities for character development.</p>
				<p>Players are not alone, however. As a game master, you'll gain dozens of pages of interesting lore and roleplaying tips that will help you make the Alrisen your own. Re-imagine the Wild Huntsman as a cursed sword of frost, or have your Perfect Chord be the world's most talented musician, all while maintaining the compelling themes that drive their individual motivations and personal quests.</p>]]>
