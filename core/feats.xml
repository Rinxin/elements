				<li>Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You learn a cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. In addition, choose a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list. You learn that spell and can cast it through your mark. Once you cast it, you must finish a short or long rest before you can cast it again through the mark. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
				<li>When you cast the 1st-level spell through your mark, you can expend one of your Hit Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.</li>

The cost to create these items is ten times the normal cost of the item. The number and type of items that can be made from a particular dragon’s corpse is up to the GM, but considering how much violence must be inflicted on a dragon to bring it down, the amount of salvageable raw matieral is low; dragons don’t die from superficial damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any type of melee weapon or bow can be made. The resulting weapon, in the hands of a proficient wielder, does an additional 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the dragon whose body was used to create the weapon. For example, a blue dragon dagger does 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any type of armor can be made except padded or chain (shirt or mail). The resulting armor or shield, in the panoply of a proficient user, provides resistance to the damage type appropriate to the source dragon.

The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.</p>

					<supports>Deep Magic Hieroglyph</supports>
					<description>
						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of animal life and every being’s place in the chain of life.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You have advantage when making ability or skill checks to identify creatures.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> You can quickly trace this glyph into the air (1 action) and stare down a beast or monstrosity. The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature is frightened of you for as long as you continue staring at it. While frightened of you, the creature must move its full movement away from you on each of its turns until you can’t see it anymore or it makes a successful saving throw. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. When the creature makes a successful saving throw (regardless of whether it failed previously), it has disadvantage on its attacks against you until the end of its next turn.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power:</strong> By carving this glyph into the bone of an animal and crushing the bone, you can grant yourself a measure of the animal’s power. You gain one of the following: a climb or swim speed of 30 feet, or a fly or burrow speed of 20 feet, whichever is most appropriate to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts for 1 hour, so long as you maintain concentration.</p>

					<description>
						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, secrets, and things hidden.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You gain a +1 bonus when making Intelligence (Investigation) checks.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> By spending 1 minute in concentration while holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell speak with inanimate object (see “Hieroglyph Spells”).</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (4th Level):</strong> By breaking open an egg (1 action), you create an extradimensional space (a “silver coffer”) large enough to hold 10 pounds of material. This looks like a simple, empty hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24 hours, then disappears along with whatever is inside it. It can be reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The silver coffer’s location in the Material Plane depends on your location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power always opens the same extradimensional space no matter how much time passes or how far you travel between uses, so it’s not a good means to dispose of (for example) unwanted or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the extradimensional space dies, any items in his or her silver coffer eventually return to their plane of origin at a random location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the creator’s death.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (10th Level):</strong> By rubbing a special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp (1 action), you cast true seeing on yourself.</p>

						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the prevention of harm, usually through the protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> When unarmored, your Armor Class = (10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier).</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (3rd Level):</strong> By drawing this hieroglyph with powdered metal on a creature (1 action), you grant that creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) for 1 minute.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (5th Level):</strong> By burning a specially crafted scroll (1 action), you conjure a squad of soldiers. These soldiers can appear different to different creatures, and even have different numbers (one person might see five soldiers while another sees eight). They appear standing inside a 10-foot square within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave that space. Within that square area, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’ space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus = (your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier), and a successful attack causes 7 (2d6) force damage. The soldiers remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on them. They never take damage and can’t be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (8th Level):</strong> By tracing this hieroglyph into the air and then limning it with a handful of magically-charged sand (1 action), you cast banishment.</p>

						<p>By burning a specially crafted scroll (1 action), you conjure a squad of soldiers.

They appear standing inside a 10-foot square within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave that space. Within that square area, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’ space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature.
