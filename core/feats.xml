• Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
• When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
• Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points.

### Weapon Master
This feat replaces the current Weapon Master feat You have practiced extensively with a variety of weapons, gaining the following benefits:
• Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
• Choose four weapons. You may add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls using these weapons.

## New Feats

### Attunement Expert
You have gained a great familiarity with magic items and how they work.
• Increase your Intelligence score by 1 (maximum of 20).
• Attuning to a magic item only requires 1 minute of uninterrupted focus, instead of a short rest.
• You can be attuned to four items, instead of three.
• When regaining charges from magic items, you can reroll if the result is a 1, taking the new result.

### Big for Your Race
Prerequisite: Must be a member of a Small-sized race
- Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You may now ignore the heavy property of weapons, and your size counts as Medium for the purpose of grappling.


### Force of Destiny
The gods have smiled on you. The forces of the universe conspire to bring you success, granting you the following benefits:
- You can retain a number of marks of destiny equal to your proficiency bonus (up from the usual 1);
- you can gift your marks of destiny to any party member without them;
- if you roll a 1 using your destiny die, you may roll again, taking the new number.

### Friend of the Wild
Prerequisite: 8th level
You gain an animal companion that can be trained and which improves as long as you travel together. Choose a beast of CR 1 or lower. This new animal companion adds a number of extra Hit Die to its health equal to 1/2 your level and adds half of your proficiency bonus to its attack and damage rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws. These numbers increase as your level and proficiency bonus increases. The GM must approve your choice.

### Reactionary
You are acutely aware of the movements and actions of your foes in combat and can react quickly to capitalize on their slightest mistakes. In addition to your normal reaction, you gain a number of reactions equal to half of your proficiency bonus. These reactions must be used for additional attacks of opportunity, and a foe may be attacked only once with this reaction.

### Silver Tongued

Sale Discount: Distance/75 + (Persuation-NPC d20 roll) = Discount percent (round to better whole number)
purchase: Advantange on your (Persuastion-NPC d20 Roll) = Purchase price discount (round to better whole number)

Example - 100mi / 75 + (10-8) = 1%

### Spellrager

Before you make a spell attack, you can choose to take a penalty to the attack roll equal to your proficiency bonus. If the spell hits, you add twice your proficiency bonus to its damage.

You can maintain concentration on up to two spells at a time, as long as those spells are of 3rd level or lower. During a turn when you are concentrating on two spells, you can only move at half speed. Additionally, you have disadvantage on constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on spells. If you fail such a saving throw, all spells you were concentrating on end.</p>

				<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You can spend 2 hours (including during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. Once the bond is formed, you can work together to bolster one another’s magic. When one of you casts a spell that requires concentration, the other can use their reaction to help maintain the spell. If the caster must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on the spell, both of you make the saving throw. If either of you succeeds, concentration is unbroken. If both saving throws fail, you both lose concentration on any spells you are currently maintaining and you both take 2d6 psychic damage from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous bond breaks. Otherwise, it lasts until the end of your next long rest.</li>

			<p class="indent">Any type of armor can be made except padded or chain (shirt or mail).

						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of animal life and every being’s place in the chain of life.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You have advantage when making ability or skill checks to identify creatures.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> You can quickly trace this glyph into the air (1 action) and stare down a beast or monstrosity. The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature is frightened of you for as long as you continue staring at it. While frightened of you, the creature must move its full movement away from you on each of its turns until you can’t see it anymore or it makes a successful saving throw. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. When the creature makes a successful saving throw (regardless of whether it failed previously), it has disadvantage on its attacks against you until the end of its next turn.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power:</strong> By carving this glyph into the bone of an animal and crushing the bone, you can grant yourself a measure of the animal’s power. You gain one of the following: a climb or swim speed of 30 feet, or a fly or burrow speed of 20 feet, whichever is most appropriate to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts for 1 hour, so long as you maintain concentration.</p>

						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, secrets, and things hidden.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You gain a +1 bonus when making Intelligence (Investigation) checks.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> By spending 1 minute in concentration while holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell speak with inanimate object (see “Hieroglyph Spells”).</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (4th Level):</strong> By breaking open an egg (1 action), you create an extradimensional space (a “silver coffer”) large enough to hold 10 pounds of material. This looks like a simple, empty hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24 hours, then disappears along with whatever is inside it. It can be reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The silver coffer’s location in the Material Plane depends on your location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power always opens the same extradimensional space no matter how much time passes or how far you travel between uses, so it’s not a good means to dispose of (for example) unwanted or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the extradimensional space dies, any items in his or her silver coffer eventually return to their plane of origin at a random location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the creator’s death.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (10th Level):</strong> By rubbing a special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp (1 action), you cast true seeing on yourself.</p>

						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (3rd Level):</strong> By tracing the hieroglyph into the air with your fingers (1 action), you force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you can immediately give it one command, either verbally or in writing, which can be completed in the next minute. The creature must try to complete the command to the best of its ability, provided doing so won’t directly harm the creature. If the task isn’t completed within 1 minute, the glyph’s power wears off and the creature is freed from the compulsion.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (9th Level):</strong> You spend an hour enchanting a piece of paper with this hieroglyph using specially prepared inks. By burning the paper (1 action), you cast a geas spell on one target. You and the target must have a language in common for the effect to work.</p>

						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the prevention of harm, usually through the protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> When unarmored, your Armor Class = (10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier).</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (3rd Level):</strong> By drawing this hieroglyph with powdered metal on a creature (1 action), you grant that creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) for 1 minute.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (5th Level):</strong> By burning a specially crafted scroll (1 action), you conjure a squad of soldiers. These soldiers can appear different to different creatures, and even have different numbers (one person might see five soldiers while another sees eight). They appear standing inside a 10-foot square within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave that space. Within that square area, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’ space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus = (your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier), and a successful attack causes 7 (2d6) force damage. The soldiers remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on them. They never take damage and can’t be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.</p>
						<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (8th Level):</strong> By tracing this hieroglyph into the air and then limning it with a handful of magically-charged sand (1 action), you cast banishment.</p>

			<p>You have gone through extensive training in gunsmithing, letting you create new firearms via experimenting. You can now create firearms, found on the chart above. You can craft special firearms, as well as Attachments and Custom Parts, if it is appropriate for your setting (such as if firearms are prominent). Once per long rest, you can make an Intelligence check with your proficiency bonus added once you complete a short rest. If you succeed, you manage to craft the blueprints for the gun or parts. If you fail, the DC goes down by 1 for subsequent checks (Minimum of 10).</p>
			<p>When the blueprints are created, you can then make the gun or parts. It is assumed that during your travels you came across the required materials to make these items before you took this feat. You craft these items at a rate of 5gp per hour, and can now craft primitive firearms at a rate of 10gp per hour.</p>
			<p>The cost to craft primitive firearms is now cut in half for you (rounded up).</p>
			<p>You can now reduce a primitive firearm's misfire number to a minimum of 1, regardless of its original misfire number.</p>
