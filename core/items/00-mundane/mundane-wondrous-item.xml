			<description>
				<p>This tarry substance harvested from the dark boughs of the death’s head willow is a powerful intoxicant. It can be smoked as a concentrate or injected directly into the bloodstream. A creature subjected to a dose of black sap cannot be charmed or frightened for 1d6 hours. For each dose of black sap consumed, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 2d4 hours-an effect that is cumulative with multiple doses.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability to psychic damage, for 1 hour. For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1d6 hours and suffer the effects of a confusion spell for 1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the frightened condition for 1 hour.</p>

There is fierce competition between local families as well as the rival wineries of Kamordah in the empire, and the numerous wines exported from Feolinn can claim a respectable bit of coin, though the prices might vary depending on the market.</p>

				<description>
					<p>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q’barra and Xen’drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls fl.owing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust’s market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools-such as the lightning rail and elemental airships-require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>

				<description>
					<p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding-which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleonsrequires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.</p>

				<description>
					<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen’drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>

			<description>
				<p>A roun, blue fruit roughly the size of a plum, a dyolet is known for its sweet flavor and the mild surge of energy granted to whoever eats it. Dyolets can also be imbued with minor healing abilities, a property kept secret by the gnomes of the Velvin Thicket until recent years. Herbalists and apothecaries can imbue healing within the fruit for a fraction of the time and gold cost of brewing a potion. A dyolet can be imbued with one of the following properties by a character proficient with a healer’s kit:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can saturate the fruit with carefully brewed curative draughts to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of healing. This process takes 12 hours and costs 15 gp.</li>
					<li>You can saturate the fruit with strengthened restorative properties to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of greater healing. This process takes 4 days and costs 70 gp.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can consume a dyolet as an action to gain its healing effect. A dyolet lasts up to 20 days after being harvested before it begins to rot. A rotting dyolet loses its healing properties.</p>

				<description>
					<p>Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon’s blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug’s effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn’t something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a fireball in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon’s blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player’s Handbook.</p>

				<description>
					<p>A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it’s now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn’t illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it’s heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.</p>

			<description>
				<p>Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance discovered throughout the wilds of the Miskath Strand. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain a round their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours. For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion-an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.</p>

					<p>The tattooist’s tools are a type of artisan’s tools consisting of two main components - the hammer and chisel. The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle.</p>
					<p class="indent">One of the main uses of tattooist’s tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an enchanted sketchbook page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.</p>
					<p class="indent">The tattooist’s tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist’s tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel’s needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual’s skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo.</p>

				<p>The Tome of Strahd is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable. If the characters acquire the Tome of Strahd and want to read these paragraphs, show the players the "From the Tome of Strahd" section in appendix F.</p>
				<p class="indent">If Strahd sees, or learns from a minion, that the tome has fallen into the party's possession, all of his other objectives (see chapter 1, "Into the Mists") are put on hold until the book is recovered. When Strahd attacks, his preferred target is whoever has the tome.</p>

				<description>
					<p class="flavor">Through the winter clouds that surround the castle on this desolate hill, you see a shape emerge. Something so gigantic, you can’t believe it can actually fly.</p>
					<p>Airships are relatively rare in Acquisitions Incorporated, which is thought to hold no more than five in its fleet. But the unparalleled usefulness of these craft in commerce—and in combat—makes the company-standard battle balloon a much-coveted upgrade for any franchise.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b><i>Origins and Operations.</i></b> Professional secrecy and aggressive marketing make it unclear where the airship originated. Some say battle balloons were an original design created by the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development department of Acquisitions Incorporated. But the wizards of Halruaa developed similar skyships in ages past, and the Cult of the Dragon has been seen with flying ships of its own. Still, among the small number of factions and organizations known to possess or build airships. Acquisitions Incorporated might be the best known for its high-profile aerial escapades. It’s certain that neither the mages of Halruaa nor the members of the Cult of the Dragon ever crewed a battle balloon with keg robots, or used one to squash a tyrannosaurus flat.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b><i>Flying Battle Vehicle.</i></b> The standard design of an Acquisitions Incorporated-grade airship features an enormous balloon covered in a rope net. Trailing lines connect the balloon to the vessel of metal and wood suspended below. In the center of the deck, directly below the balloon, sits a large magic furnace, whose formidable lifting power is rumored to involve trapped elementals. The airship’s captain controls the arcane furnace and directs forward thrust by way of a propeller located at the back of the ship, helming the craft with a wheel positioned in the bow. Metal runners below the ship allow a battle balloon to land on the ground.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b><i>Options and Armaments.</i></b> Each franchise or organization customizes the offensive capability of its airships, but most battle balloons feature multiple harpoon guns, perfect for fighting and snaring aerial threats. Battle balloons that see a lot of combat are typically well stocked with other ranged weapons and polearms for ship-to-ship and crew-to-crew fighting.</p>
					<p class="indent">Whether privately financed or loaned out by Head Office under extraordinarily cautious terms, battle balloons can be customized with unique equipment—different siege weapons, lifting and cargo gear, and so forth—to make each airship unique. However, the most potent weapon featured on most Acquisitions Incorporated battle balloons is the green flame arbalester, a massive ballista whose bolts pulse with arcane power and detonate with formidable explosive force wherever they hit.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b><i>Mobile Franchise Headquarters.</i></b> battle balloon is perhaps the most sought-after of the mobile headquarters options available to Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. The versatility of an airship allows for the rapid shipping of goods, mercenaries, and loot. Such a vessel also allows a quick escape from sticky developments and deals gone bad.</p>

					<p>A mechanical beholder takes the form of an oversized eye tyrant whose central eye is a viewport window. Part conveyance, part laboratory, and part siege engine, the vehicle can transport up to six humanoids through any terrain or medium, including underwater and through solid stone. A complex and often dangerous manipulation of gears, levers, and buttons controlled the original mechanical beholders, but more recent models feature magical controls that respond to voice commands though not always accurately.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b><i>Equipment and Options.</i></b> The mechanical beholder can be outfitted with a variety of sensors, probes, and gauges, allowing for functions as varied as determining alchemical composition, picking up on magical auras, or making masterfully dry martinis. Its range of armaments includes a disintegration ray modeled after that of its monstrous namesake (which for reasons of liability is advertised as being designed exclusively for waste removal). Portholes and hatches allow characters inside the beholder to make ranged and magical attacks from within it.</p>

			<description>
				<p>As an action, a creature can throw a vial of frigid woe up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact and releasing its contents as a cloud of spores. Each creature within 5 feet of the vial when it shatters must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see the “Eiselcross” section of chapter 3).</p>
				<p class="indent">If a character has contracted frigid woe, track the number of days that have passed so you can inform the player when their character’s symptoms appear and when they need to make Constitution saving throws.</p>
				<div class="sidebar">
					<h5>Frigid Woe</h5>
					<p>Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor’s mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross’s ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.</p>
					<p class="indent">The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor’s mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature’s body. The infected creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature’s speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.</p>
					<p class="indent">A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.</p>

					<h5>WINES OF KAMORDAH</h5>

Wines produced by these families are some of the best in Exandria, often presented as extravagant gifts or a display of wealth. These bottles fetch a healthy sum of gold, with some of the finest listed below, though the prices vary depending on the market.</p>
