			<description>
				<p>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.</p>
				<p class="indent">Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.</p>

				<p>This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p>

		<element name="Bag of Holding" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_HOLDING">
			<description>
				<p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
				<p class="indent">Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

			<description>
				<p>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
				<p class="indent">The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.</p>
				<p class="indent">An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>
				<p class="indent">The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.  When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.</p>

				<p>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the <em>light</em> or <em>daylight</em> spell. Once used, the <em>daylight</em> effect can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you mpve more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.</p>

			<description>
				<p>An <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. <em>Infernal puzzle box</em> are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty <em>infernal puzzle box</em> weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.</p>
				<p class="indent">When an object small enough to fit inside an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is placed in it, the container magically sealed shut around the object, and no magic can forced the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular <em>infernal puzzle box</em>, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box’s contents.</p>
				<p class="indent">A creature that spends 1 hour hiding an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
				<p class="indent">The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

			<description>
				<p><em>Soul coins</em> are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each <em>soul coin</em> has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag’s curse.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Carrying Soul Coins.</em></strong> To hold a <em>soul coin</em> is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.</p>
				<p class="indent">An evil creature can carry as many <em>soul coins</em> as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of <em>soul coins</em> equal to or less than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using a Soul Coin.</em></strong> A <em>soul coin</em> has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a <em>soul coin</em> and use it to do one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Drain Life.</strong> You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</li>
					<li><strong>Query.</strong> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more that a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Freeing a Soul.</em></strong> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a <em>soul coin</em> frees the soul trapped within it, and does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from <em>soul coins</em> typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.</p>
				<p class="indent">A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A <em>soul coin</em> has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a <em>hellfire weapon</em> or an infernal war machine’s furnace.</p>
				<p class="indent">Freeing a soul from a <em>soul coin</em> is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hellish Currency.</em></strong><em>Soul coins</em> are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.</p>
				<p class="indent"><em>Soul coins</em> are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p>

				<description>
					<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is composed of a set of bold lines that frame a concentrated point on the brow, representing knowledge.</p>
					<p class="indent">As a reaction when you observe another creature within 10 feet using a tool, musical instrument, vehicle, weapon, or armor with which they are proficient, you can speak the tattoo’s command word to gain the observed proficiency for as long as this tattoo is applied on your skin. Your tattoo glows and you feel a slight pinch upon your forehead as you absorb the skill and knowledge. When you gain a proficiency using this tattoo, you lose any other proficiencies gained using this tattoo. Once this property of the tattoo has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was developed during a brief war between two kingdoms as an accelerant for the training required by fledgling knights, doctors, mages, and vehicle operators. After the war ended, it was quickly adopted by prestigious guilds looking to boost their apprenticeship programs. Guilds often embedded their own iconography into the design, yielding more than a few unintended side-effects.</p>

					<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is composed of sloping lines that obscure the face’s natural features.</p>
					<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, whenever a creature looks at your face, the tattoo’s illusion magically changes its appearance to best please the creature who observes it. A creature that uses its action to examine your face can discern that it is being magically altered with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
					<p class="indent">You can also use an action to speak the tattoo’s command word and amplify its effects. Until the start of your next turn, each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo carries some taboo; it was historically used in common practice by spies, rogues, escorts, and those who rely on charming their quarry. When a nefarious guild started branding their underlings, the tattoo became associated with their minions and went out of fashion due to its limitations. In recent times, the tattoo has undergone a renaissance, newly associated with aristocrats and the leisure class as a glamour tool.</p>

					<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word and activate one of the following properties for 1 hour. Once you activate this property, the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
					<p class="indent"><b>Hawk.</b> The tattoo reforms around your eyes and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>

					<p class="indent"><b>Rat.</b> The tattoo reforms around your nose and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was the product of a collaboration between a tattooist and a druid. Together, they sought to design a tattoo that would aid adventurers that had lost some of their hearing, smell, or sight, for some reason or another. Today, it is a tattoo that is popular among those particularly vulnerable to monster attacks while traveling.</p>

					<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo symbolizes the sanctity of flesh.</p>
					<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, it magically wraps around your teeth to create sharp fangs that allow you to turn your unarmed strikes into a savage bite. Your fanged maw is a natural magic weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this bite.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was created by a troupe of vampireworshiping performers known as The Sanguine Company. They sought to emulate the creatures of their admiration. At first a purely cosmetic pursuit, it eventually grew into a violent obsession with consuming the flesh of others. As the troupe continued their travels, word spread about the nature of their tattoos and it would eventually be quietly adopted by animalistic and humanoidsacrificing cults.</p>

					<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word to make your face look exactly like that of another creature’s for 1 hour, or until you end the effect as a bonus action. You must have clear vision and be within 30 feet of the creature’s face you wish to copy.</p>
					<p class="indent">While you are disguised in this way, a creature can make a DC 13 Investigation (Intelligence) check to inspect your appearance. On a success, the creature is able to see through your disguise.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was commissioned by a wizard that wanted to enable their network of spies to operate in the field for extended periods of time without carrying bulky disguise kits. The tattoo was successfully kept a closely guarded secret for over a century due to carefully worded geas and contingency spells designed to prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. Eventually, the tattoo’s design was leaked by the wizard’s apprentice. Many years after, the tattoo was popularized among bards and other street performers.</p>

					<p class="indent">For the duration, you can close your eyes and see through the orb’s perspective (no action required). It grants you darkvision up to 60 feet, and is able to see through both magical and nonmagical darkness. During this time, you are blind with regard to your own senses.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>Cave spelunkers often find themselves exploring regions where it is impractical to carry traditional sources of light. Water-logged cave systems tend to make short work of torches and combustible gases make short work of spelunkers. Similarly, many dungeon delvers can expect to run into magical sources of darkness or other mystical impediments. This tattoo was designed to circumvent these issues by allowing the tattooed individual to produce a floating orb to see in darkness, without putting themselves at much risk.</p>

You cannot create a telepathic link with a creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or lower, or creatures that don’t understand any language.

The communication is only possible as long as you and the target remain within 120 feet of each other.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was created by an industrious wizard that wanted to build a humanoid-based communications array across multiple cities and regions. After designing the tattoo, the wizard invested a significant amount of gold into hiring workers, getting them tattooed, and then sending them off to various corners of the world. Unfortunately, they didn’t test the tattoos at a distance greater than 120 feet and only realized that the tattoos wouldn’t be capable of forming a long-distance communication network after investing a significant amount of gold into the project. The wizard’s investors were not pleased.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo’s origins can be traced back to the Cult of the Unraveled, a group fixated on extinguishing magic users and unmaking the gods of magic. Their tattoo gave them a lethal edge in close-quarters combat against magic users and items. After quietly sowing dissent towards magic among the common folk, they conducted a joint strike against powerful mage guilds in several cities. The clashes were brutal, but the cult lost and was forcefully disbanded. So thoroughly did the mages quell the uprising that the tattoo has become nearly impossible to find.</p>

					<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is fashioned after a heavy crown once worn by a being that commanded terrible power.</p>
					<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word, causing small globules of magical golden ink to leak from your tattoo and travel down your body onto your fingertips. For the next minute or until you use a bonus action to end this effect, any object you touch turns into solid gold until the next dawn.</p>
					<p class="indent">If you touch a creature, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to gold. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. A creature petrified in this way must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or remain petrified. On a success, the creature is no longer petrified.</p>
					<p class="indent">Once used, the tattoo can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was created by a powerful witch with a golden touch. She spent decades studying her innate abilities, trying to reproduce them in others. After a significant amount of experimentation with embarrassing outcomes, she was able to create a semblance of her petrifying powers through a magical tattoo. Though it lacks permanence, it is extremely effective nonetheless.</p>

					<p>This tattoo was created by a vindictive, controlling bard. They used the tattoo to command a small herd of awakened shrubs, which were forced to follow the bard and cheer for them. Eventually, the bard met their end against a group of unimpressed adventurers. The tattoo was repurposed by the adventurers for commanding people to behave and evacuate in an orderly manner during monster attacks. While effective at keeping people under duress alive, its use is considered controversial and dangerous by most.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>While mostly applied for rather dubious uses nowadays, this tattoo was initially designed for more noble purposes. Countless miners often faced avoidable accidents in their line of work, most of which were a result of sudden loss of light or vision in tunnels. A particularly concerned foreman sought to remedy this issue. They contacted an acquaintance who was able to design a tattoo that would ultimately reduce the loss of life in this line of work by more than fifty percent.</p>

					<p class="indent">As an action, you can expend 1 charge to point your finger towards a creature you can see within 120 feet of you and speak a message of ten words or less.

After the message is relayed, the creature knows it was manipulated by you.</p>
					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was originally created by underworld crime lords to conceal their identities and protect themselves from assassination. The tattoo is responsible for several high-profile raids coming up dry. As its reputation for flouting city guards has grown, so too has its adoption among nobles and merchants well-connected enough to find an underworld tattooist willing to apply it upon them.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo is a long-time favorite among bards, originally designed by a half-orc woman with a sense of flair. She was known for telling terrifying, skin-crawling stories. As a room would grow still with tension, she would use the tattoo to deliver a bone-chilling line directly into the minds of everyone listening. The effect would scare people out of their minds and she often had to pick up the tab for furniture damaged by startled crowds.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was created by an especially talented and resourceful wizard that wanted to find a way to entertain others with images from the battlefield. They devised a way to beam the contents of their sight to an illusory glass surface. The effect was short-lived, but the wizard found that rich nobles thoroughly enjoyed the live visual feed far more than other static modes of imagery.</p>

					<p class="indent">You can also use an action to speak the tattoo’s command word and amplify its effects until the start of your next turn.

A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>Many fall festivals are centered around death and ghouls, providing an opportunity for people to dress up in costumes and make light of the horrors that stalk the land. Naturally, an overzealous tattooist took this to the extreme by crafting a design that invokes genuine fear in others. While the magic is incredibly effective, the design is considered meanspirited, thus making it difficult to acquire.</p>

					<p>Orryn Jefor was a wealthy philanthropist that lost his sight at a young age. He spent some of his immense wealth on the development of a tattoo designed to give him a brief burst of sight and employed it in hand-to-hand combat against thugs in back-alley city streets. Before he died, his reputation as a heroic vigilante among the general population led to the proliferation of this design.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was originally used by nomadic tribes to more closely connect with their surroundings. After a chance encounter with some merchants moving through the land, the tattoo’s design was sketched and sold to a nearby kingdom. The king’s bodyguard used the tattoo to sniff out spies and assassins, which proved to be an effective application of its powers. Since then, the tattoo has become a popular choice among the powerful and the paranoid.</p>

It wasn’t until after their death that tattooists unearthed records of the wizard’s birthmark and discovered that it was a powerful magical tattoo. The discovery that the child may have been a kind of warlock was divisive within the wizarding community. To this day, clear information on the subject is difficult to come by.</p>

					<h5>Lore</h5>
					<p>This tattoo was created by a gnome tinkerer named Alston Thistlemask who discovered that light could be concentrated into beams through glass. They hoped that replicating the process with magic would allow them to start small fires, but were surprised to discover that the magic beams they produced were several factors more powerful and destructive. They hired the help of an artist to translate the magic into the form of a tattoo so that it was more easily transferable to others.</p>

The order only shares the tattoo with those that demonstrate their devotion to the truth through years of study and practice.</p>

				<p>When mounted at the helm of an elemental galleon or airship, this wheel allows a creature that possesses the Mark of Storm to telepathically control the elemental bound inside the vessel.</p>
				<p class="indent">If a wheel of wind and water is mounted on a mundane sailing ship, a creature with the Mark of Storm who is using the wheel can create an area of ideal conditions around the vessel, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour.</p>

			<description>
				<p>While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the <em>gust of wind</em> spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p>

				<p>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.</p>
				<p class="indent">The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.</p>
