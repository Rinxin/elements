			<description>
				<p>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.</p>
				<p class="indent">Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.</p>

				<p>This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p>

		<element name="Bag of Holding" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_HOLDING">
			<description>
				<p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
				<p class="indent">Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

			<description>
				<p>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
				<p class="indent">The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.</p>
				<p class="indent">An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>
				<p class="indent">The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.  When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.</p>

				<p>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the <em>light</em> or <em>daylight</em> spell. Once used, the <em>daylight</em> effect can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you mpve more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.</p>

			<description>
				<p>An <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. <em>Infernal puzzle box</em> are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty <em>infernal puzzle box</em> weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.</p>
				<p class="indent">When an object small enough to fit inside an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is placed in it, the container magically sealed shut around the object, and no magic can forced the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular <em>infernal puzzle box</em>, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box’s contents.</p>
				<p class="indent">A creature that spends 1 hour hiding an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
				<p class="indent">The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

			<description>
				<p><em>Soul coins</em> are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each <em>soul coin</em> has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag’s curse.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Carrying Soul Coins.</em></strong> To hold a <em>soul coin</em> is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.</p>
				<p class="indent">An evil creature can carry as many <em>soul coins</em> as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of <em>soul coins</em> equal to or less than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using a Soul Coin.</em></strong> A <em>soul coin</em> has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a <em>soul coin</em> and use it to do one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Drain Life.</strong> You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</li>
					<li><strong>Query.</strong> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more that a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Freeing a Soul.</em></strong> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a <em>soul coin</em> frees the soul trapped within it, and does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from <em>soul coins</em> typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.</p>
				<p class="indent">A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A <em>soul coin</em> has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a <em>hellfire weapon</em> or an infernal war machine’s furnace.</p>
				<p class="indent">Freeing a soul from a <em>soul coin</em> is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hellish Currency.</em></strong><em>Soul coins</em> are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.</p>
				<p class="indent"><em>Soul coins</em> are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</p>
