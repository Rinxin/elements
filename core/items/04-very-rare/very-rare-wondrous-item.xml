		<element name="Arcane Cannon" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_ARCANE_CANNON">
			<description>
				<p>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</p>
				<p class="indent">The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</p>
				<ul class="unstyled">
					<li><strong>Acid Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</li>
					<li><strong>Fire Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</li>
					<li><strong>Frost Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
					<li><strong>Lightning Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</li>
					<li><strong>Poison Spray.</strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

			<description>
				<p>This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it’s replacing.</p>
				<p class="indent">While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.</li>
					<li>You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can’t be removed against your will.</li>
					<li>The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you’re proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.</li>

			<description>
				<p>This hell-forged battle standard is made of infernal iron and fitten with a small, unopenable cage containing a quasit. The trapped quasit is incapacitated, and its cage has AC 19, 10 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage except force damage. If killed or somehow released, the quasit disappears in a cloud of smoke, and a new one appears in the cage, provided the cage is intact.</p>
				<p class="indent">While you hold the banner, your weapon attacks and those of all allied creatures within 300 feet of you count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage immunities and resistances.</p>

				<p class="indent"><b><i>Time Bandit.</i></b> At the start of your turn, roll a d6 (no action required). On a 1-3, you slow down time, gaining an additional action on your turn and doubling your speed until the end of the turn. On a 4-6, you go forward in time to warn yourself of what is to come. The next time you fail a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can reroll the check and take either result. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Fate Swap.</i></b> As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, that creature gains an additional action if it is the creature’s turn, or can take an action immediately even though it isn’t the creature’s turn.

				<p class="indent"><b><i>Dimensional Cloak.</i></b> As a bonus action, you send your body out of phase with the material world for 1 minute, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and imposing disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Once you use this feature of the dimensional loop, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Fold Space.</i></b> Choose a space you can see within 60 feet of you (no action required). You treat that space as if it were within 5 feet of you until the end of your turn. This allows you to move immediately to that space without provoking opportunity attacks, or to interact with objects or creatures in that space as though they were next to you (including allowing you to make melee attacks into that space).

			<description>
				<p>This bulky, eyeless helmet is made for a pit fiend but magically resizes to fit the heads of other wearers.</p>
				<p class="indent">While wearing the helm, you can see out of it as though you weren’t wearing it. In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.</p>
				<p class="indent">The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast <em>dominate monster</em> (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that’s not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you are not a devil, using the helm’s <em>dominate monster</em> property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent change of attracting a narzugon (see page 238), which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This opalescent, symbiotic goo comes sealed in a jar and slowly shifts and moves, as if endlessly exploring the jar’s interior. To attune to this item, you must first drink the contents of the jar, unlocking the following properties.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Resistant.</em></strong> While attuned to Kyrzin’s ooze, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you’re immune to the poisoned condition.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amorphous.</em></strong> As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you’re wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Acid Breath.</em></strong> As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbiotic Nature.</em></strong> The ooze can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you die while the ooze is inside you, it bursts out and engulfs you, turning your corpse into a black pudding allied with the daelkyr (see the Monster Manual for the black pudding’s stat block).</p>

				<p>This onyx sphere bears deep, spiraling grooves and dangles from an iron chain. While the orb is on your person, you gain the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.</li>

				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> The orb is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times. All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you automatically extinguish, and fire damage dealt by you is halved.</p>

				<p class="indent"><b><i>Borrow Object.</i></b> You name a mundane item with a value of 50 gp or less and it appears in your hand or at your feet. This can be any item that appears in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player’s Handbook, or any similar item selected with the DM’s permission.

			<description>
				<p>The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis’s network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you’re a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.</p>
				<p class="indent">In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.</p>

				<p>While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>guidance</em>, or <em>message</em> cantrips.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Portent of the Stars.</i></b> As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a d10 and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Alter Gravity.</i></b> As an action, you can cast <em>fly</em> on yourself or you can cast <em>levitate</em> (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Part of a Whole.</i></b> While this component is not installed in the <em>Orrery of the Wanderer</em>, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.</p>
