				<p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the Plane Shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.</p>

		<element name="Arcane Cannon" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_ARCANE_CANNON">
			<description>
				<p>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</p>
				<p class="indent">The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</p>
				<ul class="unstyled">
					<li><strong>Acid Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</li>
					<li><strong>Fire Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</li>
					<li><strong>Frost Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
					<li><strong>Lightning Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</li>
					<li><strong>Poison Spray.</strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

		<element name="Arcane Propulsion Arm" type="Magic Item" source="Eberron: Rising from the Last War" id="ID_WOTC_ERLW_MAGIC_ITEM_ARCANE_PROPULSION_ARM">
			<description>
				<p>This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it’s replacing.</p>
				<p class="indent">While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.</li>
					<li>You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can’t be removed against your will.</li>
					<li>The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you’re proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.</li>

		<element name="Bag of Devouring" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_DEVOURING">
			<description>
				<p>This bag superficially resembles a <em>bag of holding</em> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>
				<p class="indent">The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>
				<p class="indent">Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This hell-forged battle standard is made of infernal iron and fitten with a small, unopenable cage containing a quasit. The trapped quasit is incapacitated, and its cage has AC 19, 10 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage except force damage. If killed or somehow released, the quasit disappears in a cloud of smoke, and a new one appears in the cage, provided the cage is intact.</p>
				<p class="indent">While you hold the banner, your weapon attacks and those of all allied creatures within 300 feet of you count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage immunities and resistances.</p>

		<element name="Candle of Invocation" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_CANDLE_OF_INVOCATION">
			<description>
				<p>This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the <em>detect evil and good</em> spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.</p>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr><td class="col-20">d20</td><td>Alignment</td></tr>

						<tr><td>1-2</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr>

				<p class="indent">The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.</p>
				<p class="indent">While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.</p>
				<p class="indent">Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the <em>gate</em> spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>
				<p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket.

				<p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
				<p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>

		<element name="Helm of Brilliance" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_HELM_OF_BRILLIANCE">
			<description>
				<p>This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.</p>
				<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: <em>daylight</em> (opal), <em>fireball</em> (fire opal),	 <em>prismatic spray</em> (diamond), or <em>wall of fire</em> (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.
					</li>
					<li>As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.</li>
					<li>As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</li>
					<li>As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This bulky, eyeless helmet is made for a pit fiend but magically resizes to fit the heads of other wearers.</p>
				<p class="indent">While wearing the helm, you can see out of it as though you weren’t wearing it. In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.</p>
				<p class="indent">The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast <em>dominate monster</em> (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that’s not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you are not a devil, using the helm’s <em>dominate monster</em> property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent change of attracting a narzugon (see page 238), which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master.</p>

				<p>Four types of <em>horn of Valhalla</em> are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This opalescent, symbiotic goo comes sealed in a jar and slowly shifts and moves, as if endlessly exploring the jar’s interior. To attune to this item, you must first drink the contents of the jar, unlocking the following properties.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Resistant.</em></strong> While attuned to Kyrzin’s ooze, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you’re immune to the poisoned condition.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amorphous.</em></strong> As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you’re wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Acid Breath.</em></strong> As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Symbiotic Nature.</em></strong> The ooze can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you die while the ooze is inside you, it bursts out and engulfs you, turning your corpse into a black pudding allied with the daelkyr (see the Monster Manual for the black pudding’s stat block).</p>

			<description>
				<p>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it.  It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.</p>
				<p class="indent">Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p>
				<p class="indent">An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.  Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>
				<p class="indent">While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.</p>
				<p class="indent">In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>

		<element name="Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_NOLZURS_MARVELOUS_PIGMENTS">
		<description>
			<p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features -- such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons -- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p>

					<li>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the orb increases its range by 60 feet.</li>

				<p>This book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Intelligence score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.</p>

				<p>While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>guidance</em>, or <em>message</em> cantrips.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Portent of the Stars.</i></b> As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a d10 and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Alter Gravity.</i></b> As an action, you can cast <em>fly</em> on yourself or you can cast <em>levitate</em> (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b><i>Part of a Whole.</i></b> While this component is not installed in the <em>Orrery of the Wanderer</em>, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.</p>
