            Blackout Candle
            Uncommon Wondrous Item
            Pitch Black. When it is lit, the candle has an affect similar to
            the Darkness spell. Magical darkness spreads from the candle
            in a 20ft. radius sphere for 5 hours. The darkness spreads
            around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through
            this darkness, and non-magical light can’t illuminate it.
            Completely covering the candle with an opaque object, such
            as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this spell’s
            area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd
            level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

            mechanical locks without effort.
            You can spend a bonus action to activate it and order it to do
            so. The crawler has a movement of 10ft., 5 hit points and is
            able to climb vertical surfaces. It can not carry anything.
            When unlocking a lock, roll a d20. On a 1 the crawler makes
            a fatal mistake and gets crushed by the lock mechanism, any
            subsequent rolls to attempt to pick this lock are made with
            disadvantage. If the lock has a DC of 20 or higher you roll
            with disadvantage. If the lock has a DC of 30 or higher a 2 also
            causes a fatal mistake.

        <description>
            Port-a-Boulder
            Uncommon Wondrous Item
            Strange Stone. This 1 inch cube of stone weights next to
            nothing but it looks like it is very dense. It has a weird dim
            blue glow to it.
            When it touches any type of earthen surface of at least 5ft.
            by 5ft. it rapidly expands to a 10ft. cube of solid rock. Any
            creatures in the 10ft. cube are pushed outward and take 1d10
            Bludgeoning damage. The 10ft. cube boulder weighs 1500 Ibs
            and does not glow.
            The rock instantly returns to it’s original size when it is no
            longer in contact with an earthen surface. Alternatively it
            can be returned to it’s smaller state by speaking a command
            word which will make it shrink back to size over the course of
            1 minute.

            within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree,
            can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree
            you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of
            the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you
            have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree
            you entered. You can use this ability once per round for the
            duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.

            Mark of the Fallen. As a bonus action, when you make
            a successful attack against a creature, you can choose to
            mark it with an infernal rune. The creature has to make a
            Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failure it is marked, on
            a success nothing happens. When marked the creature has
            vulnerability to fire and necrotic damage for one minute. If a
            creature has immunity to these types of damage it becomes
            resistant, if the creature has resistance it loses its resistance.
            You can use this feature twice per day, if the save succeeds the
            use is also expended.

            Petrifying Gaze, this effect lasts until the start of your next
            turn. If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of you and you
            can see each other, you can force the creature to make a DC
            12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
            magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must
            repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a
            success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified
            until freed by a greater restoration spell or other magic. You
            can use this feature only once every 3 days.

            Essence of the Dragon. You can fill this small satchel with
            two handfuls of one of the materials listed in the Dragon
            Satchel table below. Over the course of 24 hours the material
            turns to a fine crystal powder. You can use an action to throw
            one handful of powder. The powder erupts in a 10ft. cone. All
            creatures in it have to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC
            15). On a fail they take 3d4 damage, on a successful save they
            take half damage. The damage type depends on the original
            material. Doing this twice empties the satchel after which you

    Map Beacons Uncommon Wondrous Item

            Map Beacons
            Uncommon Wondrous Item
            Split the Party. When placed on a map you can speak a
            command word which causes these tiny constructs to light up
            and hover over the place where the person it is connected to is
            currently located. If there are multiple people in one location
            they hover above each other. If they are not anywhere on the
            map the beacon lies still on its side.
            These beacons work best on detailed maps but can also give
            a general position on crudely drawn maps. If you draw a map
            (for example on the ground) it needs to have at least 3 points
            of reference and be enclosed by a rectangular edge.
            Binding the Beacon. To bind a beacon to a person they must
            hold it in their left hand and speak a command word. Binding
            to a beacon does not count towards attuned items.

        <description>

            Very Rare Wondrous Item
            Requires attunement by a Cleric or a Paladin
            Visage of the Broken. While attuned to this mask you have
            resistance to Necrotic damage.
            The One Who Endures. When one of your allies takes
            damage within a 10ft. radius, you can use a reaction to share
            in their pain. Roll a d12, you instantly heal this amount to your
            ally and you take the same amount as Radiant damage. You
            can use this feature 3 times per long rest.
            Last Act. When you die (either instantly or after failing 3
            death saving throws) the eyes of the mask will shine a bright
            white light in a 150ft. radius. Each allied creature in the radius
            heals for an amount equal to 10 times your character level.
            However, the perished attuned can not be brought back to life
            by anything short of a True Resurrection spell.

        <description>
            Nomad’s Satin Scarf
            Common Wondrous Item
            Portable Shelter. When you put this scarf on the ground
            and speak its command word, the fabric magically expands
            and transforms into a tent. The tent is 10ft. by 10ft. and can
            comfortably fit 3 medium creatures in it. It withstands all but
            extreme weather conditions and the temperature inside is
            always comfortable. You can speak the command word again
            to transform it back into a scarf. The tent has 5 hit points,
            when it is reduced to 0 hit points it automatically transforms
            back into a scarf. The scarf can’t transform back into a tent
            for 24 hours after this happens. Creatures that are inside the
            tent when it transforms back are not harmed in any way and
            remain in their positions. If the command word is spoken
            while the scarf is being worn, nothing happens.

    Arthanox the Malevolent Very Rare Wondrous Item

        <description>
            Arthanox the Malevolent
            Very Rare Wondrous Item (Sentient, Cursed)
            Faith of the Finger puppet. This puppet comes to life when
            you put it on a finger. Arthanox is sentient and rolls initiative
            in combat. He has access to the Firebolt, Mending and
            Prestidigitation cantrips. His spell attack modifier is +7. While
            Arthanox is on your finger you are not impaired to use your
            hands in any way. However, his commentary is endless.
            Personality. Arthanox used to be a cruel old wizard, it is
            unclear even to himself how he came to be a finger puppet
            but he is out for revenge and nothing will stop him in his path.
            His ultimate goal is to return back to normal (and possibly
            world domination). His alignment is Chaotic Evil.
            Fingers Crossed (Curse). Once Arthanox is on your finger
            he will not let go. Trying to do so requires an Intelligence
            saving throw (DC 24). On a failed save you take 1d8 Psychic
            damage on a successful save you remove him.
            Eternal Toy. The fabric Arthanox is made of can’t be cut by
            normal means. However, if Arthanox is destroyed his soul
            possesses a different wizard puppet in a random toy box on
            the material plane within a year.

            course of 1 minute the staff grows into a large tree with a tree
            house in it. When the tree is fully grown a rope ladder drops
            from the tree house. The tree house is 40ft. from the ground.
            The outer dimensions of the tree house are 10ft. by 10ft.

            another action to speak the command word again. The tree
            only reverts back to a staff (over the course of one minute) if
            no creatures are inside the tree house. If the tree is destroyed
            the staff is destroyed as well.

            A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are
            within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you
            are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand
            bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
            Single Spike. As an action you can place a single spike and
            speak a command word to activate it. If any creature comes
            within 10ft. of the spike the alarm is triggered.

            shapes into a clay duplicate of yourself.
            The duplicate has 80 hit points and an AC of 14. It has
            exactly the same ability scores, skills, and features as you. It
            can cast the same spells as you but doing so expends your
            own spell slots. Any bonuses you gain from magic items or
            blessings do not carry over to the duplicate.
            The duplicate is a Construct and clearly made of clay. It
            listens to your commands but can not speak. In combat the
            duplicate rolls their own initiative. The duplicate lasts for 1
            hour or until it is destroyed.
            Superior Enchantment. After using the clay you can refill
            the pot with 5 parts sand and 1 part water and close it. After
            3d6 weeks the ingredients have turned into clay which can be
            used again.

            Pulse of Greed. When you make a succesful attack you may
            roll a seperate damage die for an additional 1d8 Force damage.
            If this roll is equal or higher than your first roll, you may add
            it to the total damage. You may do this up to 5 times, so long
            as the new roll is higher than the previous roll. If a new roll
            deals less damage than the previous roll, the attack misses
            completely and you receive half of the damage you would
            have dealt to the target.

            successful save they take half damage and are not Restrained.

            Poisonburst Glypherine
            Rare Wondrous Item
            Bottled Glyph. As an action you can pour out the contents
            of this bottle or throw it at a point up to 60ft. away causing
            it to shatter on impact. The liquid creates a magical glyph in
            this location at the end of your turn. The glyph remains for 24
            hours, until activated or otherwise removed.
            Arcane Infused Poison. When a creature is in the 5ft cube the
            glyph is in, or enters it for the first time, the glyph is activated.
            All creatures that are within 20ft. of the glyph when it is
            activated, have to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15).
            On a failed save they take 3d8 Poison damage and become
            Poisoned for 1 minute. A creature poisoned in this way also has
            disadvantage on Concentration checks. On a successful save
            they take half damage and are not Poisoned.
