				<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p>
				<p class="indent">When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The sword has the following random properties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
					<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
					<li>1 major detrimental property, which is suppressed while the sword is attuned to an archdevil</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ruler of Avernus.</em></strong> As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Infernal recall.</em></strong> As an action, you can use the sword to cast <em>word of recall</em>. Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Sword.</em></strong> The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it.</p>

				<p>A weapon of Tharizdun, this dagger is a piece of jagged stone whose blade is scribed with a maze-like pattern with no beginning or end.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Blade of Broken Mirrors is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
				<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> An insane glabrezu named Ragazuu lives within the Blade of Broken Mirrors. The weapon yearns to cause chaos. It learns its wielder’s principles, then uses those ideals to encourage reckless action. The dagger whispers ideas of revolution.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The dagger grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.</li>
					<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand.</li>
					<li>Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature’s appearance. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to change your form to match any humanoid the blade remembers. Your statistics, other than your size, don’t change. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die. When the Blade of Broken Mirrors attunes to a new wielder, the appearances of humanoids it has killed are wiped from its memory.</li>

			<description>
				<p>This mace has a haft of black iron and a ruby head with a fiendish countenance. Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Mace of the Black Crown is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
				<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the Mace of the Black Crown. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder’s dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can speak, read, and write Infernal.</li>
					<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
					<li>While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.</li>
					<li>While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>

					<li>You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier’s blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature.

		<element name="Sword of Zariel" type="Magic Item" source="Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus" id="ID_WOCT_BGDIA_MAGIC_ITEM_SWORD_OF_ZARIEL">
			<description>
				<p>This longsword belong to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace. Fashioned from celestial steel, it gives off a faint glow and hum. The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can’t. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Attunement.</em></strong> The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. You alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:</p>
				<ul class="unstyled">
					<li><strong>Angelic Language.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Celestial.</li>
					<li><strong>Celestial Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.</li>
					<li><strong>Divine Presence.</strong> You Charisma score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>
					<li><strong>Feathered Wings.</strong> You sprout a beautiful pair of feathered wings that grant you a flying speed of 90 feet and the ability to hover.</li>
					<li><strong>Truesight.</strong> Your eyes become luminous pools of silver. You can see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic, and see into the Ethereal Plane, all within a range of 60 feet.</li>
					<li><strong>New Personality.</strong> You gain new personality traits, determined by rolling once on each of the following tables. These traits override any conflicting personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />

				</table>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Holy Light.</em></strong> The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword’s light disconcerting and painful, even if they can’t see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon’s radius of bright light.</p>
				<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword’s light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties, each determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Searing Radiance.</em></strong> The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you’re wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Sword of Zariel</em> is a sentient lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.</p>
				<p class="indent">The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Truth Seer.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Sword.</em></strong> Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn’t bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it’s used to shatter the Companion, unless the blade is wielded by and angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.</p>
				<p class="indent">If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy that a normal longsword.</p>

				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A short-tempered bone devil named Ashtyrlon lives within Will of the Talon. The weapon is greedy and values strong leadership. It demands that its wielder take decisive action to keep order in high-pressure situations—and to always take a fair share of treasure in return.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can speak, read, and write Draconic and Infernal.</li>
					<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
					<li>As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
					<li>While holding the war pick, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Pick a damage type from the Will of the Talon Breath Weapons table. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a DC 13 saving throw, the type of which is specified in the table. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">When you use the war pick to unleash a breath weapon of a specific damage type, you can’t choose that same damage type again until the next dawn</p>
