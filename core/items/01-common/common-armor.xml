				Blood Weapon
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A simple or martial melee weapon
				When you score a critical hit with an attack using this
				weapon, you regain a number of hit points equal to the
				damage dealt to a maximum of the hit points lost by the
				target. No effect against constructs or undead.
				Bound Armor
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A suit of armor
				As a bonus action while you aren't wearing armor, you
				can cause this armor to appear in a flash of light around
				you—instantly donning it. Also as a bonus action while you
				are wearing this armor, you can cause the armor to vanish
				entirely, instantly doffing it.
				Bound Weapon
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				As a bonus action, you can cause this weapon to disappear
				or appear instantly in a free hand.
				Cat
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				While wielding this weapon, as a bonus action you can
				activate this rune by speaking its command phrase. For
				1 hour, you can see normally in darkness to a distance of
				120 feet. Once used, this property can’t be used again until
				the following dawn.
				Chalice
				Runestone, rare
				Item: Any armor or weapon
				This runestone stores spells cast into it, holding them until
				the attuned wearer uses them. The rune can store up to
				5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains
				1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.
				Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level
				into the rune by touching the rune as the spell is cast. The
				spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the rune. If
				the rune can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without
				effect. The level of the spell used to cast the spell determines
				how much space it uses.
				While wearing this armor, you can cast any spell stored
				in the rune. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC,
				spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original
				caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The
				spell cast from the rune is no longer stored in it, freeing
				up space.
				Chaos
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				A popular project among apprentice artificers, this rune
				embodies the chaos of unbound magic. When you score
				a critical hit with an attack using this weapon, roll on the
				Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook to create
				a magical effect. If the effect is a spell that requires concentration,
				it doesn't require concentration in this case and
				lasts for its full duration.
				Daywalker
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A suit of armor with a helmet or hood
				While wearing this armor with the hood drawn, you are
				unaffected by the sunlight sensitivity trait if you have it.
				Death
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				Whenever you kill a Small or Medium humanoid with
				an attack using this weapon, it rises immediately as a
				zombie under your control with 1 hit point, as per the
				animate dead spell. The creature uses the zombie statistics.
				It remains animate for 1 minute, after which time it
				collapses and dies.
				Displacement
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A suit of light or medium armor
				While you are wearing this armor, whenever you take
				damage from an attack, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an
				unoccupied space that you can see.
				Dragon Slayer
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A martial weapon
				When you hit a dragon with this weapon, it takes an extra
				2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a
				Strength saving throw or its flying speed (if any) is reduced
				to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. If the target is
				airborne, it descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches
				the ground or the effect ends. For the purpose of this
				weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon
				type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.
				Earthshaker
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A simple or martial melee weapon with the
				heavy property
				While you are wielding this weapon, you can use an action
				to strike a point on the ground within reach, creating a
				seismic disturbance as per the earthquake spell with a
				duration of 1 round. Once used, this property can’t be used
				again until the following dawn.
				Elemental Shield
				Runsestone, uncommon
				Item: A suit of armor or a shield
				When you first affix this rune to a suit of armor or a shield,
				choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire,
				lightning, or thunder. While wearing (armor) or wielding
				(shield) this item, whenever you take damage of the chosen
				type you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an
				amount equal to twice your character level + your Constitution
				modifier and suffer one level of exhaustion. You can
				change the chosen damage type over the course of a short
				or long rest by spending at least 30 minutes in contact
				with the runestone.
				Featherfoot
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: Any armor or weapon
				While you are wearing (armor) or wielding (weapon or
				shield) this item, you have a standing jump distance equal
				to your current walking speed. Each foot you clear while
				jumping costs a foot of movement, and you can't jump
				further than your remaining movement in a turn.
				Force of Will
				Runestone, legendary
				Item: A suit of armor
				While you are wearing this armor, you can't be affected by
				enchantment magic unless you choose to be.
				Giant Slayer
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A martial weapon
				When you hit a giant with this weapon, it takes an extra
				2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a
				Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this
				weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type,
				including ettins and trolls.
				Hunt
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A simple of martial weapon with the ammunition
				property
				While you are wielding this weapon, you can use an action
				on your turn to mark a creature you can see within 90 feet
				of you. For 1 hour, when you hit the marked creature with
				a ranged attack using this weapon you can use a bonus
				action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of
				it that you can see. Once used, this property can’t be used
				again until the following dawn.
				Journey
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A suit of armor
				While you are wearing this armor, your speed increases
				by 10 feet. In addition, you can travel at a fast pace
				without suffering the normal penalty to passive Wisdom
				(Peception) checks, and your food and water requirements
				are halved.
				Knock
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A gauntleted suit of armor
				While you are wearing this armor, you can rap your fist
				on an object to cast the knock spell on it. Once used, this
				property can’t be used again until the following dawn.
				Magebane
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				This runestone has three charges. When you hit a creature
				with this weapon, you can expend a charge to cause any
				spell effects of 3rd level or lower on the target to end. Additionally,
				for each spell of 4th level or higher on the target,
				make an ability check using your weapon ability. The DC
				equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the
				spell ends. The runestone regains 1d3 expended charges
				daily at dawn.
				Mariner
				Runestone, common
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				This weapon or ammunition fired with it magically repels
				water. Attack rolls you make using it aren't made with
				disadvantage for being underwater.
				Mark/ Recall
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A suit of armor
				While you are wearing this armor, you can use an action to
				magically mark a surface on which you are standing.
				While a location is marked in this way, you can spend 1
				minute concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell).
				At the end of the period, you and up to five willing creatures
				within 5 feet of you teleport to the marked location,
				and the mark vanishes. Once you mark a location, you
				can't do so again until the following dawn. If you mark
				another location while you already have a mark, the older
				mark vanishes.
				Mime
				Runestone, legendary
				Item: Any armor or weapon
				This runestone is able to mimic the properties of magic
				items. A creature can spend a short rest spent focusing
				on a magic item and this runestone. The magic item must
				be of the same type as the type of equipment to which
				this rune is affixed. Focus usually takes the form of quiet
				meditation or other appropriate activity. If the short rest
				is interrupted, the copying process fails. Otherwise, at
				the end of the short rest the runestone gains the properties
				of the magic item, excluding any fixed bonuses such
				as those to attack and damage rolls, spell save DC, and
				Armor Class. If a property has charges, it is copied with no
				remaining charges.
				Only the properties of one magic item can be copied at
				a time. The mimicking process overwrites any existing
				copied properties. The process automatically fails when
				attempting to copy the properties of artifacts.
				Nondetection
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: Any armor or weapon
				While you are wearing (armor) or wielding (weapon or
				shield) this item, you are hidden from divination magic.
				You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through
				magical scrying sensors.
				Overshield
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A suit of heavy armor
				While you are wearing this armor, you gain 8 temporary hit
				points at the start of each of your turns.
				Phoenix
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A suit of armor
				When you're reduced to 0 hit points and start dying while
				wearing this armor, this rune immediately casts fireball
				centered on you. At the start of your next turn, instead of
				rolling a death saving throw, you regain 1d6 hit points.
				Once used, this property can’t be used again until the
				following dawn.
				Retribution
				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A suit of armor or a shield
				While you are wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) this
				item, whenever you take damage from a creature you have
				advantage on your next attack roll against creatures of that
				type before the end of your next turn.
				Serpent
				Runestone, uncommon
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt
				to poison it. The target must succeed on a Constitution
				saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The
				creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
				of its turns. On a success, the effect ends. Once used, this
				property can’t be used again until the following dawn.
				Soultrap
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				When you kill a creature with a challenge rating equal to
				or higher than your level with this weapon, you regain one

				Superconductor
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				This runestone captures and stores magical potential for
				short-term use, and can hold a number of spell levels equal
				to the proficiency bonus of the creature attuned to it. When
				you are targeted by a spell while holding this weapon, the
				runestone gains a number of charges equal to the level
				of the spell, up to the maximum the runestone can hold.
				When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon,
				you can expend a number of charges to deal an extra 1d6
				force damage per charge expended.
				This item loses any accrued charges when you finish a
				short or long rest.
				Tempest
				Runestone, legendary
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with
				this weapon it takes an extra 1d10 lightning damage. An
				arc of lightning then leaps from that target to as many as
				three additional creatures of your choice within 30 feet of
				it, which also take 1d10 lightning damage.
				Thief
				Runestone, common
				Item: A suit of armor
				A favorite of cutpurses and thieves. Once per day while

				While you are wearing this armor, you gain a flight (hover)
				speed equal to twice your walking speed.
				Warmage
				Runestone, rare
				Item: A suit of armor or a shield
				This runestone has three charges. While you are wearing
				(armor) or wielding (shield) this item and fail a concentration
				saving throw that you make to maintain concentration
				on a spell due to taking damage, you can expend a charge
				as a reaction to reroll the saving throw. If you do so, you
				must use the new roll.
				You can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to
				recover an expended charge.
				Warrior
				Runestone, common
				Item: A simple or martial weapon
				Popular among mercenaries and soldiers, this runestone
				ensures you keep your sword in your hand. While you

				Runestone, very rare
				Item: A simple or martial melee weapon
				In darkness, the unsheathed blade or head of this weapon
				sheds moonlight, creating bright light in a 15-foot radius
				and dim light for an additional 15 feet. In addition, when
				you hit a shapechanger with this weapon, it takes an extra
				2d6 damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving
				throw. On a failure, it immediately assumes its true form if
				it was shapechanged and it can't shapechange until the
				end of its next turn.

	Adamantine. An ultra-hard alloy of adamant, silver,  and electrum. Adamantine is black with a green tinge that sharpens to purple-white under light from most magical sources. Armor made of adamantine reduces incoming bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage by 3 if it's heavy armor, or 2 if it's medium armor. Shields made of adamantium have a +1 bonus to AC. Equipment made of adamantine can't be destroyed, damaged or suffer from wear.

	Cold Iron. A rare pure-formed iron, mined deep underground and forged at lower temperatures to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron deal an additional weapon damage die against fey creatures. 

	Darkwood (Zalantar). This rare magical wood has similar properties to beech, oak and yew for bow-making while being extremely light and durable. Longbows and heavy crossbows made of darkwood don't have the heavy property.

	Deep Crystal. Deep crystal is a mineral of above-average quality found at the heart of large veins or deposits, and is renowned for its strength and magically resonant nature. Weapons made of deep crystal can be used as a spellcasting focus.

	Dragonhide. A rare type of leather armor made from the supple underbelly hide of a dragon. While wearing dragonhide armor you have resistance to the damage type associated with the dragon from which it is made (for example, blue dragonhide armor confers resistance to lightning damage).

	Ironwood. Ironwood is a magical substance created from normal wood by druids. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells and effects that affect metal do not affect ironwood, whereas spells that affect wood do—although ironwood will not burn.

	Mithral. Known to the dwarves as truemetal, this shining silvery-blue metal is lighter than steel yet just as durable. Equipment made of mithral weighs only half as much as the same item made of normal metals, and has no Strength requirement. Additionally, armor made of mithral can be worn under normal clothes, and doesn't impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when it otherwise would. Small creatures do not have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons made of mithral.

	Shadowsilk. Highly prized by assassins and cutpurses, shadowsilk is cloth made from magically woven shadowstuff. While wearing normal clothing or a gambeson made of shadowsilk and no other armor, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when attempting to hide in dim light or darkness.

Rules for Special Materials
The following general rules apply to arms and armor constructed using special materials:
	• Armor and shields constructed using adamantine or dragonhide have a base cost equal to twenty times that of the same item made exclusively of normal materials. Armor and shields constructed using other special materials have a base cost equal to ten times as much.
	
	• Weapons made of special materials vary in price, typically costing upwards of 2,000 gp. In addition, weapons made of special materials automatically possess the silvered and magical tags, which count when determining the cost of any subsequent upgrades.
