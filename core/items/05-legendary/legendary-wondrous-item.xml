				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When Danoth’s Visor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You see invisible creatures and objects within 60 feet of you as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.</li>
					<li>As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and use the goggles to see into and through solid matter. This vision has a radius of 60 feet and lasts for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
					<li>As a bonus action, you can speak a command word to switch the goggles into spyglass mode. While in this mode, creatures and objects viewed through the goggles are magnified to twice their size. Speaking the command word again reverts the goggles to their normal operation.</li>

		<element name="Holy Symbol of Ravenkind" type="Magic Item" source="Curse of Strahd" id="ID_WOTC_COS_MAGIC_ITEM_HOLY_SYMBOL_OF_RAVENKIND">		
			<description>
				<p>The Holy Symbol of Raven kind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven-or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.</p>
				<p class="indent">The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.</p>
				<p class="indent">The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hold Vampires.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> If you have the-Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sunlight.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).</p>

		<element name="Icon of Ravenloft" type="Magic Item" source="Curse of Strahd" id="ID_WOTC_COS_MAGIC_ITEM_ICON_OF_RAVENLOFT">		
			<description>
				<p>The Icon of Raven loft is a 12-inch-tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.</p>
				<p class="indent">The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.</p>
				<p class="indent">While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a protection from evil and good spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Augury.</em></strong> You can use an action to cast an <em>augury</em> spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of the Undead.</em></strong> You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cure Wounds.</em></strong> While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<element name="Infernal Tack" type="Magic Item" source="Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus" id="ID_WOCT_BGDIA_MAGIC_ITEM_INFERNAL_TACK">
			<description>
				<p>A narzugon devil binds a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) to its service with <em>infernal tack</em>, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, withing 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.</p>
				<p class="indent">The tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.</p>

				<p>This dodecahedron of faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears. A set of handles are affixed to its sides, and it pulsates and thrums when touched.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fragment of Possibility.</em></strong> A creature that touches the beacon and concentrates for 1 minute receives a Fragment of Possibility, which looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows the creature around, staying within 1 foot of it at all times. The fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used. Once the beacon grants a Fragment of Possibility, it can’t grant another until the next dawn. A creature with a Fragment of Possibility from a Luxon beacon can’t gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.</p>
				<p class="indent">When a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it can expend its fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Soul Snare.</em></strong> If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone a ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon beacon, their soul is ensnared by it. This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon.</p>

		<element name="Spell Bottle" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_SPELL_BOTTLE">
			<description>
				<p>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.</p>
				<p class="indent">When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.</p>
				<p class="indent">While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>You have immunity to lightning damage and thunder damage.</li>
					<li>When you hit with a weapon attack that normally deals bludgeoning damage, it deals thunder damage instead. When you hit with a weapon attack that normally deals piercing or slashing damage, it deals lightning damage instead.</li>
					<li>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to be struck by lightning. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
