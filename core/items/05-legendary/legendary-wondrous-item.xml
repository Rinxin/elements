			<description>
				<p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p>
				<p class="indent">The apparatus of the crab is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Armor Class</strong>: 20</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>
				<p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.  The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
				<p class="indent">The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>
				<p class="indent">A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p>

				<p>While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become invisible. While you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing is invisible with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.</p>
				<p class="indent">Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.</p>

				<p class="indent">You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the Gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.</p>

					<li>As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and use the goggles to see into and through solid matter. This vision has a radius of 60 feet and lasts for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt.

		<element name="Deck of Many Things" type="Magic Item" source="Dungeon Master’s Guide" id="ID_WOTC_DMG_MAGIC_ITEM_DECK_OF_MANY_THINGS">
			<description>
				<p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.</p>
				<p class="indent">Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>
				<p class="indent">Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.</p>

				</table>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Balance.</em></strong> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Comet.</em></strong> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Donjon.</em></strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.  You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.  You can't be located by any divination magic, but a <em>wish</em> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Euryale.</em></strong> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Fates.</em></strong> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flames.</em></strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fool.</em></strong> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gem.</em></strong> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Idiot.</em></strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Jester.</em></strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Key.</em></strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Knight.</em></strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Moon.</em></strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <em>wish</em> spell 1d3 times.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rogue.</em></strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a				<em>wish</em> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ruin.</em></strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Skull.</em></strong> You summon an avatar of death -- a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>
				<h1>Avatar of Death</h1>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Star.</em></strong> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sun.</em></strong> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Talons.</em></strong> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Throne.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vizier.</em></strong> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Void.</em></strong> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A <em>wish</em> spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>

			<description>
				<p>The Holy Symbol of Raven kind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven-or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.</p>
				<p class="indent">The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.</p>
				<p class="indent">The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hold Vampires.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> If you have the-Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sunlight.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).</p>

				<p>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
				<p>Four types of <em>horn of Valhalla</em> are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.</p>

				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of the Undead.</em></strong> You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cure Wounds.</em></strong> While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

			<description>
				<p>A narzugon devil binds a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) to its service with <em>infernal tack</em>, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, withing 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.</p>
				<p class="indent">The tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.</p>

Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong><em>Soul Snare.</em></strong> If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone a ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon beacon, their soul is ensnared by it. This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon.</p>

			<description>
				<p>Used to summon night, this 6-inch-diameter, jet-black orb is cold to the touch. You can spend 10 minutes to activate it, causing the area within 10 miles of it at the moment of activation to become night even if it is daytime. This night lasts for 24 hours, until you cancel it as an action, or until your attunement to the pearl ends. Once used, the pearl can’t be used again for 24 hours.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.</p>
				<p class="indent">When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.</p>
				<p class="indent">While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
				<p class="indent">The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p>
				<p class="indent">The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <em>gate</em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a <em>portable hole</em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.</p>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr><td>d100</td><td>Result</td></tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>01-50</td><td>The sphere is destroyed.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>51-85</td><td>The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>86-00</td><td>A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.</td></tr>

					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Balance.</em></strong> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Comet.</em></strong> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Donjon.</em></strong> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.  You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.  You can't be located by any divination magic, but a <em>wish</em> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Euryale.</em></strong> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Fates.</em></strong> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flames.</em></strong> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fool.</em></strong> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gem.</em></strong> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Idiot.</em></strong> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Jester.</em></strong> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Key.</em></strong> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Knight.</em></strong> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Moon.</em></strong> You are granted the ability to cast the <em>wish</em> spell 1d3 times.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rogue.</em></strong> A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a				<em>wish</em> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ruin.</em></strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Skull.</em></strong> You summon an avatar of death - a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>
					<h1>Avatar of Death</h1>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Star.</em></strong> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sun.</em></strong> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Talons.</em></strong> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Throne.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vizier.</em></strong> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>
					<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Void.</em></strong> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A <em>wish</em> spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>

			<description>
				<p>This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The grisly cover decoration on the first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.</p>
				<p class="indent">If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expend in a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
				<p class="indent">While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.</p>
				<p class="indent">Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.</p>
