				<p>Each scroll of protection works against a specific type of creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by rolling on the following table.</p>
				<p class="indent">Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-footradius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.</p>
				<p class="indent">The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends.</p>
				<p class="indent">A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.</p>
