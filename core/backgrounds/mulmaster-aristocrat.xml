			<p>From your hilltop home, you have looked down (literally and perhaps figuratively) on the unwashed masses of Mulmaster for your entire life. Your fur-trimmed robes and training in the visual and performing arts mark you as wealthy and perhaps well-born; you are a member of the City of Danger's aristocracy.</p>
			<p class="indent">None of your immediate family members sits on the Council of Blades or is even a Zor or Zora…yet. Nevertheless, you are one of Mulmaster's elite, and whether you personally covet a higher standing or not, you are at home in the dance halls where the aristocracy gathers to plot, to scheme, to do business, to discuss the arts, and, above all, to see, and to be seen.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Performance</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of artistic artisan's tools and one musical instrument</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of artisan's tools or musical instrument, a set of fine clothes, and a purse containing 10 gp.</li>
				<li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Wealthy</li>

			<p>Mulmaster is run by and for its aristoracy. Every other class of citizen in the city defers to you, and even the priesthood, Soldiery, Hawks, and Cloaks treat you with deference. Other aristocrats and nobles accept you in their circles and likely know you or of you. Your connections can get you the ear of a Zor or Zora under the right circumstances.</p>
