		<description>
			<p>Poised between the worlds of the living and the dead, dhampirs retain their grip on life yet are endlessly tested by vicious hungers. Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s deathless prowess in the form of increased speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite. With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs turn to the lives of adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who’d tempt their hunger.</p>
			<h4>DHAMPIR HUNGERS</h4>
			<p>Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. This desire is a whisper in the mind, a tinge to the sight, a reflex constantly needing to be suppressed. Those who overindulge their thirst risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress it through constant, molar-grinding restraint. In any case, temptation haunts dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give them endless reasons to indulge.</p>
			<p class="indent">While many dhampirs thirst for blood, your character might otherwise gain sustenance from the living. Roll on or choose an option from the Dhampir Hungers table to determine what tempts your character to feed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag’s influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in wild shades, lengthy hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as long life, darkvision, and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.</p>
			<p class="indent">While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.</p>
			<h4>HEIR OF HAGS</h4>
			<p>One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called a “eldercross” or “witch’s turn.” This living, garland-like part of a hexblood’s body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.</p>
			<h4>HEXBLOOD ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>A bargain with a hag or other eerie forces transformed your character into a magical being. Roll on or choose an option from the Hexblood Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.</p><h5 class="caption">Hexblood Origins</h5>

			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Type:</strong> Fey and Humanoid</li>
				<li><strong>Size:</strong> Medium or Small (choose when you gain this lineage)</li>
				<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fey Resilience.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hex Magic.</em></strong> You can cast the disguise self and hex spells with this trait. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you gain this lineage). Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spells slots you have.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magic Token.</em></strong> As an action, you can harmlessly pull out one of your nails, a tooth, or a lock of hair. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can use an action to send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are on the same plane of existence and are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words. In addition, while you are within 10 miles of the token, you can use an action to enter a trance for 1 minute, during which you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token’s location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. Afterward, the token is harmlessly destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you create a token using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal fates, their ashen flesh, missing limbs, or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>
			<h4>FADED MEMORIES</h4>
			<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Lost Memories</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d8</td><td>Memory</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>A memory causes you to shed a tear. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You recall enjoying something that you can’t stand doing now. What is it? Why don’t you like it now?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>You faintly remember a place that couldn’t possibly exist. What is this vision? How does it make you feel?</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>You experience a memory you’re certain isn’t your own. How does it seem unnatural? Could it be a glimpse of a past nightmare or something worse?</td></tr>

			<h4>REBORN ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>Reborn might originate from circumstances similar to those of various undead or constructs. Roll on or choose an option from the Reborn Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Reborn Origins</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d8</td><td>Origin</td></tr>

				<tr><td>1</td><td>You were magically resurrected but something went wrong.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Stitches bind your body’s mismatched pieces, and your memories come from multiple different lives.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>After clawing free from your grave, you realized you have no memories except for a single name.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You were a necromancer’s undead servant for years. One day, your consciousness returned.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You awoke in an abandoned laboratory alongside complex designs for clockwork organs.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>You were released after being petrified for generations. Your memories have faded, though, and your body is not what it once was.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Your body hosts a possessing spirit that shares its memories and replaces your missing appendages with phantasmal limbs.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>In public, you pass as an unremarkable individual, but you can feel the itchy straw stuffing inside you.</td></tr>
